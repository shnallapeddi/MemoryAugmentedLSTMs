we stayed at the tru hilton and decided to try a restaurant that was close. prasino received high stars on yelp so we gave it a go. we had reservations at 8pm and checked in at 7pm. we knew we were very early but decided to get a cocktail at the bar. they indicated they would come and find us for our table. we checked in again at 7:45pm and they had no record we were there. we had to go up 2 more times before we were seated at almost 8:30pm. we had the chicken caprese sandwich and 1/2 roasted chicken. neither meal was very good. i chose salt and paper chips with my meal which looked like they opened up a bag of lays and dumped them on my plate. this was far below the service and quality i expected for the atmosphere and price of this place. so disappointed.,0

customer service is absolutely terrible since miss rachel is no longer working at this establishment.,0

"i saw this before 'bubba ho-tep' at the fantasia film festival in montreal. everything about it is either tipping the hat to (or completely ripping off) tim burton. i enjoyed it nonetheless, even if it is extremely derivative. what most impressed me was the quality of the visuals given the obvious shoe-string budget. the set design and the props were inventive and original, although the script definitely was not.",1
"Okay, sorry, but I loved this movie. I just love the whole 80's genre of these kind of movies, because you don't see many like this one anymore! I want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off, or a cheesy imitation, what is it imitating? I've never seen another movie like this one, well, not horror anyway.<br /><br />Basically its about the popular group in school, who like to make everyones lives living hell, so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named Marty. It turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks.<br /><br />So, its like 10 years later, and the group of friends who hurt Marty start getting High School reunion letters. But...they are the only ones receiving them! So they return back to the old school, and one by one get knocked off by.......Yeah you probably know what happens!<br /><br />The only part that disappointed me was the very end. It could have been left off, or thought out better.<br /><br />I think you should give it a try, and try not to be to critical!<br /><br />~*~CupidGrl~*~",1

hifi is a great place to start or end your night. walking in with the buzzing of either people chattering or a ring in your ear from previous bars. hifi will keep the good vibes going.",1

"we adopted our daughter from russia 12 years ago and we wanted her to have the experience of trying russian food. needless to say we were not disappointed  in the least. this restaurant is excellent and the owners are incredibly nice. deanna took the time to talk to us and my daughter about russia and also give us excellent advice on the menu. gregory is an amazing pianist and also very nice and friendly. we left feeling like we made new friends.

the borsch soup was incredibly good, the sauteed beef with mushroom was tender and very tasty, and the potato type pancakes definitely hit the spot. the banana type pudding cake is highly recommended. the best part about the food is that why its  very good, it's also very unique in its taste which makes eating there a new and great experience.  this is not your typical run of the mill restaurant in indy. we will definitely be back.",1
