"Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but Europeans did, and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines.<br /><br />But then in the third episode he says that when the Europeans in South Africa got too far north they ran into Zulu people and other tribes that *herded cattle and planted crops*. So what explains their lack of technological, economic, and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for success?<br /><br />Diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox (brought to North America by black slaves) were our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus *without a single casualty* in either case, then I think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant. With or without germs, we were going to succeed.<br /><br />He says Malaria stopped Europeans from colonizing further North, killing ""thousands"" of Europeans while not affecting Africans. (I'd like to know real numbers but he doesn't say.) Then at the end he says today Malaria is killing thousands of Africans and that is why they can't catch up with us. So which is it, Jared? Did Malaria help the Africans by halting Eurpeans or hurt them? And how come Europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history? <br /><br />He also seems far too eager to say that the reasons Europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck. At times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories he's reluctant to admit that maybe Europeans were successful because they worked for it. It's sad watch this obvious neo-Marxist contort reality to try to prove his point.",0
ordered the shrimp. it was awful. smelled bad and was mushy. had a large egg that was grwsy and smelled off on top of it. rice was hard. ordered iced tea with lemon and got a lime. had to get up and ask waiter who was busy texting on his phone for a refill. had to get up and ask him for sugar...service was poor to non-existant. overall yucky food. would not eat here again.,0

ok. so the wife and i go to this place after seeing the sign up for awhile.  we order take out.  been waiting for 30 minutes now.  meanwhile a man was eating his to go order at a table besides us. he gets up and leaves without paying and the waiter has to chase.  turns out he was too drunk to know he had to pay.  general tso chicken was good and the spring rolls were good as well.,0

"This movie is so unreal. French movies like these are just waste of time. Why watch this movie? Even, I did not know..why. What? The well known sex scene of half-siblings?

Can you find easily in life, half sibling doing such things?<br /><br />Did I learn something from this movie? Yeah: some people are just so fond of wasting time making such movies, such stories, such non-sense. But for those who like nihilism, nothingness in life, or simply a life without hope, then there you are.. you've got to see this movie.<br /><br />Only one worth adoring, though: CATHERINE DENEUVE.

"After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. But there was actually no need for a second one. First of all, if Cruela is returning, don't cure her and make her insane again. Just make her break away from jail and that's a rap. I thought it was not very funny. It's supposed to have only one original puppy returning. I'd expected that it should be Lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having Roger and Anita back too. However, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot that thinks he's a dog (clever). Gerard Depardieu's part was pointless. At the end, Cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true. She gets baked inside a giant cake. That was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. That just didn't work. It was too much over the top, and not too funny. I actually felt sorry about Cruella.",0

"i wish i could give them zero starts!!
i financed a bed frame through one of their finance companies and was advised that the bed would arrived within a week. two and a half weeks later, i called the tampa office (where i was advised their management team is) and spoke to a person named sara, whom i later learned was actually ""rose"". she is the manager of all of their stores according to the country side location rep ""david"". rose used a false name because she was being very rude and even hung up on me after she butchered my name. i went to the store physically and spoke to another employee who advised me that sara is actually the name that  rose uses when she is upset with customers. this was very very upsetting to see a company using this type of practices. the same employee told me that the company does not give out the owners information because the owner doesn't care. she said that the owner let's the tampa management team do whatever they want and rose gets complaints all the time and covers them up. 

back to my original issue, october 18th i still had not received my bed frame which i ordered on sept 25th. after i called and spoke to the ""rose"" (who was trying to use the name sara) i advised her that i hadn't received the bed and was wondering why i was being charged when i haven't received the product yet. she said she would call me back after she looked into why i haven't received it, she said that it looked like it slipped through the cracks and the sales person failed to follow up and make sure that it was delivered. after 1 hour i get a call back and the same person, ""rose"" butchered my name and when i asked her, ""seriously? you cannot say my name?"" she immediately hung up on me. i tried to call back and no one would answer. i called 5 times no answer. i called from my husbands phone and immediately she same person, ""rose"" answered and when i said why are you guys ignoring my calls, she hung up on me again.2 hours later, just before their store closes, the same person ""rose"" calls me back and says i can have the bed their tomorrow, do you still want it, i said, ""absolutely not"". i have never wanted anything canceled so much in my life. she said ok, it's canceled and hung up on me. i went to the store the next day and that is when i spoke to veronica, who advised me that i was actually speaking to ""rose"". just to confirm i called back a week later and asked for ""rose"" and once she answered, i recognized her voice right away.

here we are another month later and the finance company is still billing me and they advised me that ""furniture distribution center"" stated that everything was delivered. (lies). fdc was supposed to look into it further and hasn't returned their calls yet. i'm beside myself with frustration. i have posted on their ad in facebook numerous times about their poor customer service and they keep deleting it. this play is as shady as they come. 

please stay away from them. if you have any issues this is how they treat you. owner has to know and does nothing about it. you don't even have a way to reach out to anyone beyond their management. what kind of company does that?",0
"I know i loved this movie when i was 12-14 years old. Now that i am 24 i watched it again, and i wished i hadn't. Because all the things i laughed at when i was younger, is no longer funny. so this is an hour and a half without fun. For me the jokes were lame, not funny or just too childish. So the same thing i loved about the movie when i was a kid, is now the things i don't like about it. Besides not being funny it is not actually believable at all. The evil character is very poorly done but i guess that is the kind of movie it is. And the last 20 minutes of the movie is pretty lame with bad fighting sequences and so on... But if you are young you will probably love it. I rate this movie 4/10",0

i wanted to like this place and was so excited to try it but unfortunately i don't think i will be back. the service was decent but not good. the menu looked like the food would be so good but i was disappointed. my bacon was completely burnt and i was kind of surprised they would serve it to me like that. the waffles were decent but i wasn't aware it would come with mascarpone on the bottom even though i didn't ask for that and it wasn't listed on the plain waffles. they do have a large gf selection but i would opt for somewhere downtown instead that has better food + service.,0

"first of all, fuck pep boys. 

i thought, hey great. this place is so close to home and i need an oil change, inspection, and to figure out what the hell is going on with my car (it was making a weird noise). 

i made an online reservation for the next day. i got a confirmation email. sweet. 

and this is where pep boys began to show it's true colors. i got a phone call the morning of my appointment. the guy started bitching about the online reservation system because it inconvenienced him. he made such a big deal about it that i thought he was cancelling my appointment. he *graciously* said he would fit me in. 

i get there and check in my car. the staff had no idea what kind of materials to use in the oil change. then, i began explaining the sounds my car was making. i made the mistake of saying i didn't know much about cars. 

i got a call 3 hours later saying that my bearing is fucked. it would be $700+ to fix it. i called bull shit. the guy said i was being unreasonable and stupid for not letting them just fix it. i may not look now much about cars, but i know when some asshole is taking advantage of the fact that i am a woman. 

i picked up my car, where the pissy guy again complained that i knew nothing and should just let him fix my car. 

i got the work done at a place i have trusted for years for half the price. my father in law (a mechanic) said that no one in their right mind would charge more than $450 for this job.

"Some Plot Spoilers Ahead.<br /><br />The Nashville Network's so-called rebirth as ""The First Network for Men"" is a complete disappointment, as was its block of adult cartoons. The new Ren and Stimpy was just plain awful, ""Gary the Rat"" mediocre at best, and ""Stripperella"" pretty unwatchable. This cartoon is mostly boring; if ""Ren and Stimpy"" suffered from gross-out overkill, ""Stripperella"" lacked any decent shock gags, funny witless gags, clever gags, or gags, period. The concept is bad to begin with: Pamela Anderson, a stripper-cum-superheroine, saves ""The City"" from an assortment of goofy supervillains. This cartoon seems like an homage to superior wacky superhero spoofs, like ""Darkwing Duck"" and ""The Tick,"" but without those cartoons' wit and good writing---or even good storyboarding. ""Agent 0069"" tries to vacillate between being goofy and sexy, but she is neither, and this cartoon's failure to make her one or the other brings this series down.<br /><br />Watch your taped episodes of ""The Tick,"" and see what a real superhero spoof cartoon is like.",0

"my girlfriend wanted to buy a new car so she stopped by toyota of tampa bay to check out a particular corolla hatchback they had in stock. she had a terrible experience and ended up leaving so frustrated that she asked me to take over for all of the car shopping/negotiating, moving forward. after she told me what happened, i decided that weren't going to be buying a car from these dudes. i don't even think we'll ever even get her oil changed here.

first, i'd like to first note that after all of this happened, i tried to reach out to the dealership's general manager. after about 3 weeks of waiting, we still haven't heard back from anybody. they had their chance. review time--here's why these guys suck:

1. when she got to the dealership, she told the sales consultant that was helping her (his name was charlie ubas) that she had somewhere to be at 6:00pm and wouldn't be able to stay for very long. she told him that she was only there for a test drive and to see if they would be able to beat another quote from a nearby dealership. after some time, she started expressing that she had to leave, but charlie kept telling her, ""two more minutes."" she ended up leaving 35 minutes later than she had planned to because, in her words, it was always ""just two more minutes.""

2. charlie had asked her if it was okay that he checked her credit with a soft-pull. she specifically asked if him doing that would result in a hard-pull; he expressed that it would not.

it did.

when she got to her car, she saw that she received an email from her credit monitoring service that a hard pull had been ran, which is not okay--specifically because she requested them not to do that and had been told that only a soft-pull would be ran. from their google reviews, i noticed that this is a common practice here. this really isn't okay--especially when it's not understood and agreed upon ahead of time.

3. at some point during her visit, she needed a pen to write something down or take some notes so she asked another employee there if they had a pen that she could borrow. the employee that she asked replied, ""i'm kind of in the middle of something,"" and just turned around and walked away. she noted that his tone was rude and stand-off-ish.

i don't need to describe how unacceptable this is. if it helps, she described the employee as being a heavyset, older (possibly 60's, maybe early 70's) white male in a white button-down shirt. watch out for him, he's not polite. and he definitely won't give you a pen if you need it.

4. charlie had tried to get her to sign a sales agreement document without telling her what it was. this had occurred while they were still discussing the overall deal; nobody had told her that what the document was. at best, this was sketchy as a motherf.

there are a couple more things that came up (e.g. changing the terms of the service agreement after they had already been negotiated), but i think that i've touched on the most important aspects of her experience that i think everybody reading should know about.

again, before leaving reviews all over the place bad-mouthing these guys, i tried to give them an opportunity to make it right and address these issues. the fact that i've been ignored suggests that these issues could be their work-culture stemming from the top-down.

good luck you guys. but take my advice and start looking at another dealership first.",0

"Another film to punish us for the crime of enjoying ""Pulp Fiction.""<br /><br />If you like watching people get killed by machine gun fire for an hour and a half, this'll probably fit the bill. Fans of the debut episode of ""Aeon Flux,"" wherein the title character slays literally thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers single-handedly, will really go for it.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's not exactly a clever movie. In fact, all it is is an excuse for a bunch of young people to act rude and shoot people. Sometimes an entire scene goes by, and the only thing that happens is, you guessed it! someone gets shot. Or, to spice things up, twenty people get shot. First, they're just sitting there, the next minute, they're sitting there dead. Yahoo!<br /><br />Rough plot: A young American goes to Paris (An American in Paris, get it?), hires a prostitute (the ethereal Julie Delpy), gets in touch with some old French buddies, one of which has AIDS, they plan and attempt a bank heist. Of course, movie convention states that no bank robberies on film go off w/o a hitch, and this hitch takes up about three-quarters of the running time (it's like ""Dog Day Afternoon"" without the Sidney Lumet's wit, patience, or humanity). While at the bank, things go wrong (surprise!), and the Parisian with AIDS, goes wacko with his Uzi several HUNDRED times. No spoilers here, but suffice to say that you're at such an emotional distance from these characters that it's not likely you'll care who lives and who dies by the end of the film.<br /><br />Some have called it stylish. Perhaps it is, but it's someone else's style, it's a movie that's already been done, and ""Killing Zoe"" is trapped by convention. Nowhere in the course of the movie does the director (Roger Avary, co-winner of the ""Pulp Fiction"" screenplay Oscar) do anything really original, stylish, funky, or outrageous. Unless you consider the fact that no movie that has taken place inside a bank has had such a high body count, there isn't anything else to set this one apart from the multitude.",0

The weapons looked like something out of a final fantasy game, and the dual bow and arrow was just dull as anything I have ever seen.<br /><br />Next movie you decide to make try investing in some wireless mics, better script and try actually spending some time on your stunts.<br /><br />Honestly there are shows on t.v. that play ever night and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this one.<br /><br />Stick to martial arts (unless its as poor as your acting) then take up quilting.",0
"even though it is mandatory in hillsborough county for restaurant staffers to wear masks when serving gino's is not requiring their staff to do so. we love certain foods there so it's one of our favorites. we got there early to obtain a seat away from others. the place filled up and there was  no  social distancing between tables. our wait person put on her mask when i asked about it and she kept social distancing. she's our favorite wait person. 
as two much older men came in with face masks they were seated near everyone else and removed their masks and their young wait person had no mask on not even sitting on her neck and she's speaking and spewing information right at them. clueless and oblivious to any sense of safety. i hope these old guys are going to be ok. 

so if you are one of those who think you want to help here immunity by being exposed this is your kind of restaurant! go for it!  if you'd rather stay safe and healthy then pickup your order and stay away!  i wore my mask as we walked through the crowded room to leave. i hope we're still healthy in two weeks. 
for me i will give my business to businesses who care about their staff and their customers.",0
An uninteresting addition to the stalk 'n slash cycle which dominated the horror genre in the 1980's. This was filmed as Pranks but released as The Dorm That Dripped Blood which is an obvious steal from the 1970 horror anthology The House That Dripped Blood. Daphne Zuniga is the only recognisable face in the cast and this was her first horror movie (she has also appeared in The Initiation and The Fly II).,0

"stay far away from this place.  i would give them zero stars if i could.  i called for an emergency appointment because i had a severe toothache.  emphasized both over the phone and in person that i was someone with extreme dental phobia.  the place has every single bell and whistle possible but zero sense or empathy.  all they care about is a hard sell to pay for that fancy equipment.  i did not see a dentist for over an hour while technicians x-rayed, cleaned, and mapped my teeth while pressing me about my long term goals and an extensive treatment plan.  i kept telling them i was in a lot of pain and my ""goal"" was to have my painful tooth taken care of.  and all the things they were doing to me were causing more pain.  finally someone told me one of the dentists ""might"" have time to treat me.

by the time the dentist finally came in, my pain and anxiety had morphed into a full-blown panic attack.  dr. keith robinson spent maybe 90 seconds with me and then left the room never to return.  by that time i was crying from the pain and asked for my husband to come in.  the nasty hygienist came in with a couple of prescriptions for me and to tell me the dentist would not treat me due to my anxiety.  he didn't even have the decency to tell me himself but sent in a paper with a referral to a sedation dentist-as if i would trust any recommendation this place would give me.

so i am still in severe pain, can only eat soft foods, and my dental phobia is 10 times worse than before.  and i'm sure i am looking at a bill for hundreds of dollars for services i did not ask for while my emergency was never addressed or even acknowledged.  i believe in supporting local businesses whenever possible but, if there is any justice in this world, this place will be put out of business and all that fancy equipment sold at auction.",0

"Although I have to admit I laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies I saw.<br /><br />The budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors. The production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch. Reminds me of the Robot Monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on.<br /><br />In one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off. Geez, hard to believe but the Black Knight scene from Holy Grail was more realistic. I kept wondering why the victim didn't start shouting "" None Shall Pass"" and "" It's only a flesh wound, I've had worse"". It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the past year.<br /><br />The ""gladiator/demon"" was a stitch too. Between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical.<br /><br />Truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable.

"For Daniel Auteuil, `Queen Margot' was much better. For Nastassja Kinski, `Paris, Texas' was much better. The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges (`CrissCross' and `A World Apart' cannot even be compared with this one), and Goran Bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from `Queen Margot' for this movie (Attention to the end of the film). If this was an American pop movie, I would not feel surprised at all; but for a European film with more independent actors and director, a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple-minded and disappointing. There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people. There are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone. And finally, there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys. Every character is shown in simple black and white terms: the good versus the evil. Plus, from the very beginning, I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? I believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie. I think this movie was not disturbing, but very disappointing.",0

The story is about the main character coming back from the previous movies' success to ruin it all with this load of trash. Why did the makers want to destroy the reputation of the past 2 films with this cheap junk. The story is so lame that had to be a outrageous sequel. I mentioned Cobra earlier because it has the same mood, that one man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch. Both this movie and Cobra were bent on showing the hero firing his guns at hip level and the enemy falling in large numbers. Police officers spend hours at the shooting range so why did they get gunned down by gang members firing aimlessly from their hips?

"This is probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Independent or not, solid writing is a must. Ditto for directing and acting. I know these actors can act (I've seen them in Sporanos and more...) but this movie is very bad, very bad. Maybe it's the script, maybe it's the director. Probably a little of both.....Probably a LOT of both! Technically OK, Just bad, bad, bad... I have a theory that the backers for this movie also own the Poker magazines, because I saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines. "" Hey' we made it, so it's gotta be good, right?"" Not so fast Bucky. I know it takes a lot of hard work and money to even get a movie made, much less sold and distributed, and for that I commend these folks.

I've never seen a Tarzan movie that even comes close to Edgar's vision. Maybe one day Hollywood with trust talented and respected authors to tell the story.

"One of the best silent dramas I've seen. As dark and shadowy as anything the German Expressionists produced, but featuring performances that were quite understated and naturalistic for the day. No camera mugging and no unintentional laughs due to wild-eyed arm-waving histrionics. Sjostrom gave a convincing performance as the drunken, mean-spirited and frightening David Holm.<br /><br />Set mostly at night in a dingy Swedish slum, the film had a very claustrophobic set-bound feel to it, aided by the low key lighting and extensive use of irising.<br /><br />There was a deep, and typically Scandinavian, sense of despair and hopelessness to the narrative: the film begins in a rather grim present, and then we're told David Holm's story in a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks within flashbacks--a pretty complex story structure for 1921), where his character is offered numerous chances at redemption, but he doesn't take them, and we know he won't take them, because we've seen him die drunk and wretched and mean as ever in the present. The penultimate scene is as dark as any I have seen in all of cinema.<br /><br />The writing and directing is tight and intelligent, even by today's standards. In several instances, Sjostrom skillfully sets the audience up to suspect one thing, and then pulls out a surprise. The ending might not be such a surprise to some viewers, but I didn't see it coming.<br /><br />This movie deserves a full restoration and DVD release. Or even a crappy budget release. It just needs to be out there so people can see and appreciate it.<br /><br />9.5/10, which rounds up to 10/10",1
"Shuai is a burly and uncouth young Beijinger with a punkish haircut, who ekes out a living selling cheap books from a stall in an indoor market. He wouldn't appear to have anything in common with the wiry, middle-aged, would-be intellectual, Zhang - and yet the two of them wind up in a restaurant together discussing the pro's and con's of murder (the Chinese title would perhaps be better translated as 'Talk It Over'). If that makes it sound kind of pedestrian, don't be misled: this film is profusely inventive in its plot, and mostly races along at breakneck speed (although the pace does flag quite badly towards the end).<br /><br />If you only know Zhang Yimou's worthy historical dramas like Raise The Red Lantern and Shanghai Triad, or his more recent martial arts epics, Hero and House Of Flying Daggers, you'll be amazed; in fact, whichever of his other films you've seen, you'll be surprised, pleasantly surprised - this is far and away his most original, most quirky, most experimental work. It was shot within a couple of weeks on a minimal budget, almost entirely on location in Beijing (and making use of many ordinary Beijingers in the smaller supporting roles - there's even a fleeting cameo by the director himself), and mostly with a hand-held camera, in a jerky, hyper-kinetic style which is a million miles from the elegant formalism of his best-known films.<br /><br />OK, I live in Beijing, so I find an additional delight in all the bizarre little details of everyday life that I am coming to recognise and relish (even though it was shot in '97, and things are changing so rapidly here), but I really think this film can be appreciated by anyone. I saw it, as I have so many other Chinese 'comedies', at a movie club that screens sub-titled versions of recent Chinese films for an almost exclusively expat audience; and it is the only one I can recall where the audience was laughing out loud. Some non-Chinese audiences might find it a little too strange, a little uncomfortable at times, in that it does include some violence, and, after opening as a breezy, offbeat romantic comedy, mutates into something much darker in its second half. It is, however, very, VERY funny.<br /><br />It's also superbly acted by the two leads, especially long-time Zhang Yimou collaborator Jiang Wen, who is probably mainland China's foremost film star, and has a brooding screen presence reminiscent of a young Depardieu or De Niro.<br /><br />Watch this film - for proof that the Chinese have a sense of humour that CAN translate to other cultures, for proof that Zhang Yimou is far, far more than a one-trick pony...... and for a thoroughly good time.",1

"What looks like a ho-hum Porky's rip-off turns out to be quite a touching film about being young and in love.<br /><br />The story concerns three friends, Gary, Ricky and David, who spend their after school hours looking for sex. When a new girl arrives in town Gary falls head over heels in love with her.<br /><br />The film goes from being a sleazy sex film to an examination of teenage insecurities. It is funny and sad at the same time. It never completely gives into that love story formula that seems prominent in every movie made. You know the guy meets girl, guy loses girl, guy gets girl back in the final frame formula. That formula is tossed aside after guy meets girl. Maybe that is why I liked the film so much.<br /><br />The soundtrack is especially good and the ending is a definite tear jerker. It also might be one of the most realistic endings I've ever seen in a love story.<br /><br />",1

"This has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made. While ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Say Anything"" deliver nice portrayals, this movies strips down useless subplots and Hollywood divergences. This movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance. You never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people. You almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it. This movie is mostly all dialogue -based. But, every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing. What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. How in all that conversation, while often having no real bearing on anything critical, you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other. This is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone. And what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe. This could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random. And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place. It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this film, I don't think I will ever tire of that.",1

Just the right mix of fast moving story, entertaining characters, hilarious moments (but not overloaded with stupid jokes), and fun performances by Kelsey Grammar, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron Schneider, Rip Torn and more. Buckman is especially good, and I really enjoyed watching the guy who played Stapanick.<br /><br />I also find it interesting that they used a real submarine, the Pampanito, for the running on top scenes and emulated it almost exactly for their sets. The set decoration is really impressive if you do a digital tour of the Pampanito online and then compare it to scenes in the movie. They did an excellent job on this film.<br /><br />What a light entertaining and truly enjoyable movie!",1
"The Argentinian music poet, Atahualpa Yupanqui, once said that some folk music repeats similarly at any country of the world. They look the same but everybody consider them as their own folk music...<br /><br />This film, as I feel it, is about the same music that repeats all over the world at some time of each country's history. First, a few listen it playing and try to make the others hear it. Then some, believe that they hear it, but they don't. Then, nobody says anything and some people appear to listen to it. And others recognize that they have heard it, but didn't think that others might be hearing it. Finally, everybody listen to the same music, and suddenly it doesn't sound any more...<br /><br />Love and poetry, as a real nationalism and the legacy of a father to his children...<br /><br />Why would he call the film, The Dead when nobody dies?

The only remark is that they should have maybe shown a bit more deeply the connection between his inspiration and his abuse of alcohol and women. But altogether this is an excellent film!",1
"The phenomenon Helge Schneider defies easy description or quick categorization. Yet, for the international audience not acquainted to him, one could say he's something like a crude mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman, adding a foible for Jazz music and 70s outfits. While his stage performances already are eccentric, his movie works are simply hilariously outrageous.<br /><br />""00 Schneider"" is, in my opinion, Helge's best movie. He stars in the two leading roles - police detective ""Kommissar 00 Schneider"" and murderer-villain ""Nihil Baxter"", and also in a precious smaller role as physician ""Dr. Hasenbein"".<br /><br />In the opening scene, we see how modern-art-loving Baxter accidentally kills the circus clown Bratislav Metulskie, from whom he has bought a malfunctioning used Jaguar, when a beloved sculpture slips out of Baxter's hands, fatally hitting Metulskie. Upon reading about the incident in the newspaper, 00 comes back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick, Lt. Koerschgen, who is played by an elderly actor bearing the same name. They pick up Baxter's track quickly, and interrogate him at his weirdly decorated mansion (one of the movie's best scenes!), but initially fail to gather any proof. The story winds through many turns, with several scenes that don't always really contribute to the progress of the plot but are hilariously funny, such as a daydream by 00 (including the most unusual view on a running man's brief-clad crotch in movie history), a police-department party during which Koerschgen gets into a row with the chief and has to be hospitalized, and a visit at the already mentioned Dr. Hasenbein's. Baxter, then, is finally caught attempting to escape to Rio de Janeiro on a plane.<br /><br />Always worth special mention is Andreas Kunze who in this case plays 00's wife, as he's usually appearing in drag performing women's roles in Helge's Movies.<br /><br />So all you folks out there looking for new laughs, I strongly recommend this movie. The catch? You have to understand German (as I doubt there's an English version around)...",1
"If there were two parts that the physically towering, ugly-charismatic actor Gérard Depardieu was born, as a Frenchman, to play, it must surely have been Cyrano de Bergerac and the orator Georges Danton. Here he dominates the film both through the breadth of his shoulders and the power of his voice; his charisma carries the part despite the fact that it is made clear that the character has as much blood on his hands as any of the rest of them. Danton feasts while the people of Paris starve... but he is the one man who can challenge the tyranny imposed by the dreaded Committee of Public Safety in the name of 'freedom', and he is presented as the hero of the film -- despite the fact that the source play practically idolises his opponent Robespierre!<br /><br />For those who know the characters from history, there is interest to be had in identifying the minor parts: the frog-faced Tallien, Couthon the cripple, Fouquier-Tinville the tribunal's prosecutor, the dashing fop St-Just, the epic painter David. But the script cuts little slack in this respect; names are often late in coming if minor characters are identified at all, and there is no Hollywood-style 'info-dump' to make sure that the audience can place events in their historical context. The film takes it for granted that you know what has gone before, and what will happen after -- sometimes it takes too much for granted, as when it relies on a close knowledge of dates to provide the sting to its tail in the fact that Robespierre followed Danton shortly to the scaffold.<br /><br />Considered as a film, it's not entirely satisfactory in that it ebbs away towards the end. The structure of the story leads up to some great confrontation between the protagonists in the courtroom or some dramatic climax to the trial, which, thanks to history, never actually happens. Things just fizzle out: there is no revolt, there is no overthrow of tyranny, there is no assumption of power by the victor, there is no triumph on either side. It may be historically accurate, but it's not entirely satisfying as the outcome of a screen scenario -- it seems an odd place to stop. As others have commented, it might have been more logical to take events up to the end of the Terror and show in apposition the fall of Robespierre.",1

"Perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the USA, ""Duckman"" runs short at 70 episodes in four seasons.<br /><br />Unlike the often innocuous criticism found in ""The Simpsons"" (a pretty good show in its own right), and the rude-for-rudeness-sake humour in ""South Park,"" every bit of this series follows a plan. The criticism of US society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, carries much more bite than it does in any other animated series.<br /><br />The cultural references in ""Duckman"" also tend to be obscure sometimes (anyone browsing the fan sites will realize most have not even been caught). In that, it is different from ""The Simpsons,"" which usually uses pop culture instead of the high-brow stuff often hidden in ""Duckman."" As other people writing about it notice, there is a growth in the characters (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed). Also, by making the main character not just an offensive neurotic but in fact someone who is living a personal tragedy (as is made clear in episodes like ""The Once and Future Duck"" ('You'll love her until the end of your days...') and in ""Bev Takes a Holiday"" (when he takes a chance to tell Beverly all those things he couldn't tell Beatrice), the series is anchored in a deep sense of reality.<br /><br />One can't avoid feeling sorry for him and his lucid madness.<br /><br />All in all, in my opinion, the best cartoon ever made in the USA and one of the best series ever. I doubt it will ever be on DVD though. Far too many things the Duck said make much more sense today.",1
"fun market in st. pete beach. not quite the spectacle that is the saturday morning market in dtsp, but solid nonetheless. some of the same vendors work both markets, so if you're looking for a completely different st. pete market experience, you won't find it here. that being said, this is the perfect market for those who don't like ridiculous crowds, or who want to go straight to the beach after grabbing your favorite boba tea, bakery item, or bbq. the best part of this market is that it is on a street with brick-and-mortar shops and restaurants as well. fun stop if you're in st. pete beach.

"my fiancé and i ordered uber from here after a long or what felt long to me from our house. as we are trying to eat healthier, this place seemed like a good idea. 

we loved the idea of creating our own bowls. there were a lot of customization. especially considering we are pescatarians. we could sub in proteins for more veggies. the only thing i wished was different was the sauces. i kept thinking if only an herb ranch sauce or this sauce didn't have balsamic. 

ultimately, i didn't eat my bowl with the sauce. still tasted great.",1

"WHENEVER an idea was successful during those ""Golden Days"" of the Silent Movies, you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated; although ""Reworking"" is the term that is used. Of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us, for success in the Movies or TV always leads to a trend; with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit Movie or TV Program.<br /><br />TO this last premise we strongly disagree; for this is copycatting or plagiarism, plain and simple.<br /><br />THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, surely must have been quite well received; for ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach/MGM, 1929) was reworked on the Roach Lot, not once, but twice over the next three years. We were treated to LAUGHING GRAVY (Roach/MGM, 1931), in which the Goat was replaced with a cute, little puppy-dog. Also, the weather is transformed into the dead of Winter, in the middle of a blizzard. They also made other line-up changes with substituting Landlord Edgar Kennedy with Landlord Charlie Hall.<br /><br />THE second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP (Roach/MGM, 1932), which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct Circus, to which Stan and Babe were former employees. The Circus paid off its employees with their assets and the Boys received the Chimpanzee as their final payday.<br /><br />BACK to our original 'victim', today's subject, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? THE short starts off simply enough. The boys encounter the Goat on the street and the Nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house; after Stan feeds a doughnut to her. The comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between L & H and slow-burn exponent, Edgar Kennedy, their Landlord. The incident's impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night. And as luck would have it; their room is situated directly above the Landlord's quarters.<br /><br />IN addition to the noise, the bathing of the goat, its odor and Landlord Edgar's suspicions about Laurel & Hardy's having another person illegally in the room; we were most amused by a little throw-away gag, which may well have been missed by the Censors. While admonishing the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person's being in there overnight, regardless of their sex.<br /><br />ITS camera shot is made from inside The Boy's room, over their shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and facing them, he warns; ""Remember, this is a respectable establishment!"" Just as he says this, a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the Landlord; followed by a uniformed Sailor, who cocks his hat forward as they pass! POODLE SCHNITZ!!",1

the staff is always really nice. not a heck of a lot of places to sit-but i usually take my edible treasures and find a more picturesque locale (or my couch)

"went to body restoration with a friend on a visit to philadelphia this past weekend. my friend had her massage with lisa and said it was the best massage she ever had. 

i was kind of unsure about my experience at first because i was wearing a robe in a waiting room with some other folks. i was completely covered, and so were they, but if i was any heavier (i am a size 18) i probably wouldn't have been covered up. still, it was fine.

my appointment was with cara and some people in these reviews haven't spoken well of their massage experience with cara saying it was just ok. i have had probably a hundred or so massages in my life, and i can assure you, my massage with cara was the best i have ever had. 

i am a quiet person, and cara let me quiet and really just enjoy the massage.  i did assure her that i wanted a deep tissue massage and liked to feel like my muscle issues were well worked out at the end and she did just that.  i tried to let her know that the pressure and work on sore spots was just right, and she kept it up throughout the massage. it was a fantastic experience and i will definitely go back to body restoration and ask for cara again next time i visit philly!",1

"Watching Fire and Ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year. It wasn't at all a bad movie, certainly not average, but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one-dimensional (which, perhaps as based on Frank Miller's comic book, was the right decision to go with). But its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody sword-led combat, with the occasional freaky creature or super-hot female to go with the painterly surroundings. While I would probably re-watch Fire and Ice before 300 again, they both aroused that similar feeling - the exception this time being, naturally, that it's Frank Frazetta, the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics, collaborating with director Ralph Bakshi, in what isn't typical Hollywood fare but something for the die-hard fans.<br /><br />What this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time (it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their Masters of the Universe VHS tapes back in the day) is the possible cons mentioned before and, maybe, that you will see something somewhat unique. Fire and Ice isn't even the only Bakshi rotoscoped feature, but it's possibly the most fluid- if not quite my personal favorite- of the few he made, and he and his team create a whole striking world that's part pre-historic, part out-of-this-world fantastic, and part medieval, and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds, the skies and grounds. There's a slight drawback for Bakshi fans in this facet of character design; Bakshi went as far as to say it's more Frazetta than him. This may be true, but it doesn't make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we don't see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion (my favorite was the momentary skeleton-guide- how they rotoscoped that amazes me).<br /><br />I neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it. If you're already a die-hard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a 'damsel' or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada, so suffice to say it's about, well, Fire against Ice, with characters named Nekron and Darkwolf (the coolest male of the lot and most comic-book in appearance) and Teegra (the typical hottie who's almost *too* perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure). What the plot does do, as an asset, is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action, the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle, like when the ogres are hunting after Teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes. And per usual for Bakshi, he conjures up some craziness (if not quite his usual inspired lunacy) in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material. If you've seen Wizards, you'll understand what I mean to a lesser extent.<br /><br />So, if you're an animation buff, seek this out right away for some 'old-school' (i.e. 1980s) action and incredible design. For everyone else, it's... good, not great, as I would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension, with some alterations, 300.",1

"Apparently Ruggero Deodato figured out, early on, that his story wouldn't work if he approached it too seriously, so he decided to camp it up. The result is a film that can be viewed as either a ludicrous sword-and-sorcery epic or as a very entertaining comedy! And I think I'll go the second way. The brief gore moments are well-done, the Paul Brothers openly mock the material (they even bark at each other in one scene!), and there is also a charming, spirited, good-natured performance by Eva La Rue, as the girl who tags along with the ""boys"". Plus, where else can you see the insides of a dragon lighted like a discotheque?? (***)",1
"for some reason, the look of this placed beckoned us in on a chilly evening strolling down state st. and we weren't even planning to have dinner out. we weren't even aware the italian restaurant wasn't at that location anymore. the place was about half full at 5:30pm. we were seated immediately, the service was excellent with really cool host and servers and our food came super fast. the regular craft ramen (husband got pork, i got chicken) was really yummy and pleasing. nice portion servings, too. also, the soup wasn't so hot that you had to wait 15 minutes for it to cool down, which i usually experience with ramen and udon soups. all we got was two bowls of ramen and water so our bill was super reasonable. and their water doesn't taste like the horrible sb tap water so maybe it was filtered... or i hope it was. it was a great experience and we'll be back. i want to try the vegetable ramen next time.",1
"i experienced monk's for the first time last weekend with a buddy of mine. he had nothing but good things to say about this place. after one dinner there, i see what he was raving about. this place is fantastic.

they do not take reservations at monk's so be ready to wait for your delicious grub. although, with a ginormous beer menu in your hands, you shouldn't have much of a problem waiting. i had a couple glasses of allagash white during our wait. this is a tradition belgian wheat beer. very tasty.

when they were ready to seat us, we followed the hostess through the front dining room, down a hallway to another dining area, then down yet another hallway to a back dining room. this place is a lot bigger than you would expect with 3 dining areas.

i wanted to try everything on the menu, but since there were only 2 of us, we ordered the frog legs, pomme frites, monks mussels, and lapin a la guauze (the rabbit entree). the frog legs were cooked buffalo wing style - deep-fried and covered in buffalo sauce. it was meaty and tender. pomme frites came with a yummy garlic mayo. monks mussels were tender and juicy steamed in a white parsley and garlic broth. the rabbit was braised in gueuze lambic. 
everything was cooked to perfection.

this place deserves 5 stars and 2 exclamation points!",1

i ate the eggs served your way breakfast and believe it or not had grits for the first time. these grits were soooo good and i am usually against ever trying them but i am very glad i did. the eggs were scrambled perfectly and i tried my so's pancakes which truly gave you that homemade good eating feel. next time i am in new orleans i will surely be back for breakfast!",1
"This was very good, except for two things which I'll mention at the end. The animation is great, highlighted by Nick Park and company's trademark of exaggerated teeth and mouths of the characters, which make you laugh almost every time you see someone. The color was magnificent, too.<br /><br />The best part of the film, however, is the clever comedy woven throughout. This is another of these animated films in which there is so much to see and hear each frame that it would require many viewings to catch all the gags. It's just a funny exaggerated look at the oddball ""Wallace"" and his silent-and-smart dog ""Gromit."" Along the way, it pokes fun people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens, something akin to how the obsessive dog lovers were pictured in ""Best Of Show.""<br /><br />My only complaints were two typical traits of today's films, animated or not: 1 - let's make the cleric in the film look like a total idiot; 2 - let's overdo the final action scene with the predictable result but way overdone. Those aside, this is still a very amusing film that should provide a lot of laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy multiple times.",1
"Garam Masala is one of the funniest film I've seen in ages. Akshay Kumar is excellent as the womaniser who has affairs with 3 girls and engaged at the same time. John Abraham is Amusing at times and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is superb as usual in most of his films. The director Priyadarshan has delivered great Movies in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul being some of the Best. Garam Masala is his funniest film he has made. The three newcomer actresses are average. Rimi sen doesn't get much scope in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple storyline of a guy having a affair with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house. Packed with loads of Laughs, this is one Non stop Entertainer.",1

Ten years later i hitched hiked through the country side of France, and i sure would have been keen to see Michelle. The film is probably not very sophisticated by todays standards, more's the pity, but it seemed rather racy back then. A few years later a sequel was made with Michelle living in a high rise in Paris and Paul coming back to meet her, just like life they had moved on, the film was very downbeat. Still the original was fab, and if you can get a copy go rent it, just remember to give it its' due and treat it gently. I note Americans can be rather prudish, so take note, contains scenes and themes possibly upsetting to middle America.",1
"first time i went to woody's was when mstrkrft was spinning and it was a cool place with shirtless  bartenders.  the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th time i went with my gay friend and it was a cool place with shirtless bartenders.  

drinks are expensive.  the company, fun.  potential to meet everyone in the gayborhood, high.  

the first floor is where you go to get drinks and mingle, but if you like to dance your rear-end off, the second floor is the place to be.  everyone is uber-friendly and loves dancing.  downside is that  you have to pay cover to get onto the dance floor.  i kinda just move with the ebb and flow of the place.  chill out on the first floor, then move up to the 2nd floor bar outside of the dance floor area and chat it up with new friends and finally, pay cover to get onto the dance floor.  afterwards, everyone heads over to the midtown diner.

"Thank God for the Internet Movie Database!!! When I first got this movie I watched it every night just before before bed and was getting something different out of it every time. But no matter how I sliced it, it came up disturbing. The black and white and all the twitching really freaked me. You stare at the screen unsure of what you are looking at, and just when you think you got it, it becomes clear and it's something completely different. The imagery is VERY disturbing, twitching and straight razors do not sit well with me in any movie. Still everytime I watched it, I was interpreting it somewhat differently (there is no dialogue, ya know), so I decided to check the IMdB for the plot summary. Boy that throws me for a loop, I had no idea that was supposed to be God. Now I'm going to watch it with this in mind and see what happens....",1

"""River's Edge"" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and for a year that also saw ""Blue Velvet"", you know thats saying something. Viewed today its lost little of its power and remains much better than the overrated ""Kids"". The previews for ""Kids"" played it up to be an expose of the deterioration of the nation's youth. In reality, it was little more than an exploitation film based mostly around shock value. ""River's Edge"" was promoted as a teen exploitation flick but was in actuality much better. The only times it goes from being disturbing to distasteful is the constant image of the dead nude body. Outside of that, the film is thought-provoking and, for all its minor flaws, quite realistic.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves, known for being a particularly wooden performer, gives his best performance as a burned-out teenager. Ione Skye is equally sympathetic and likable. Dennis Hopper (on the comeback trail with this, ""Blue Velvet"", and ""Hoosiers"") gives a great performance as the creepy yet pathetic hippie generation leftover. Crispin Glover, while always entertaining to watch, seems a bit out of place as the manic stoner and leader of the group. The best performance however is definitely Daniel Roebuck. As the murderer John, Roebuck is frighteningly emotionless. Its a shame he didn't become a bigger star as hes a much better actor than Reeves.<br /><br />The film is overall fantastic and daring. Don't mistake this for another lame John Hughes clichéd high school flick such as ""The Breakfast Club"". This is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. Fans of this movie are advised to check out a Canadian film from 1981 called ""Out of the Blue"", directed by Dennis Hopper. Its another shockingly bleak examination of the generation gap and, despite its obscurity, may have been an influence on ""River's Edge"". (7/10)",1

"when our trek to house of kabob failed due to them being closed for observance of eid, the bf and i decided to detour to the closest acceptable restaurant around the corner, ginger thai. i guess fate or just life has a way of knowing what's best for you because this place delivered! we came on a sunday around 11:30 am so the restaurant was still quiet. we seated ourselves and, after looking at the fairly extensive menu, ordered the thai style papaya salad, duck curry and some pho/ramen like broth with vermicelli noodles called sukiyaki. all were ordered very spicy. 

the papaya salad was flavorful, with both the spice and pungent fish sauce coming through. it comes with a bit of raw cabbage to ease the hot. the duck curry was delicious--broth was very satisfying and spicy, and i kept going back for more. the only critique i had was that the duck wasn't as tender as i hoped and was also pretty fatty. my bf seemed to enjoy his noodle dish. 

price for both was around $40, so pretty standard fair if not a little higher than most thai places. would definitely revisit this place again, and not as a detour.",1

If you have seen any CKY or Viva La Bam you will notice that everybody (from those two) are in it.

He does this by having Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dicamillo) vandalize her house. There are many different characters with many different stories.<br /><br />There is great music on the soundtrack.

"While I hold its predecessor, ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High,"" as a standard to which other teen comedies should be compared, ""The Wild Life"" is one of the better lesser known films from that time-and a worthy sequel, if you can call it that. I believe its tagline reads, ""From the makers of FTARH, something even faster."" This definitely holds true. Though it may lack the depth of the former which tackles issues like first dates, teen sex, and abortions, ""The Wild Life"" is, nonetheless, a great flick. It's pure chaotic fun, especially due to Chris Penn's over-the-top character, Thomas Drake. If Spicolli was high on coke instead of weed, he would be Drake. Eric Stoltz, in his first major role, is great as the straight-laced Bill Conrad. The two characters work well off one another. Think a younger, hipper Odd Couple, complete with 80's gloss. Outside of them there are so many other great things about this film worth mentioning. Lea Thompsom has never looked cuter, especially during the scenes of her working at the donut shop. Jenny Wright is just delectable and fun to watch. Rick Moranis plays a great nerd/perv who is dying to get in her pants. Thomas Drake's wrestler buddies are hysterical, especially Benny, the little Puerto Rican guy, who says some pretty memorable lines. One in particular that he yells out during a night out at a strip club had me on the floor the first time I saw it. That's saying something! Finally, the movie ends with one of the best 80's party scenes on film, ever. Look out for special appearances by Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones, Leo Penn (Sean and Chris Penn's dad), and a random Michael Jackson look-alike at the party. Throw in a score by none other than the man himself, Eddie Van Halen, and you can't go wrong. For Van Hagar fans, keep your ears open for riffs that would be found on such albums as 5150, OU812, and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge.<br /><br />If anything disrupts the flow of the movie it is a small subplot involving Randy Quaid as a burned out Vietnam vet. It just seems out of place and unnecessary. Other than that, it's near perfect. If your a fan of mindless but fun 80's movies and have not yet seen this one, you're in for something special. RENT IT NOW!!! <br /><br />p.s.-The credits say Cameron Crowe has a cameo as one of the cops in the film. Does he have his back turned during his scene because I have yet to find him.

"When I first saw this show, I thought it looked interesting. I watched it, saw how it revolved around Sarah, like the character sees the world...revolving around her. I got it, but wasn't laughing very much.<br /><br />Onstage and in her show, she's racist, crude, insensitive and hugely self-centered. I didn't get her at first, and took it all at face value. Then I got to see her movie, Jesus is Magic. I think that served as a Sarah Silverman primer for me, explaining to me just what 'language' she's speaking. She's like Marilyn Manson, working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images, but you eventually realise it isn't an assault, it's a statement. And once you understand that, you find you're glad someone's finally giving it to you straight.<br /><br />I don't mean to suggest only smart people will understand, or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy. While I like a lot of 'smart' shows, I still to this day do not see the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I get the impression that it's good, but I just don't get it. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman Program, but I'm glad I eventually came around.<br /><br />The creators of this show do work hard, every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot, but with songs, or dream sequences, production numbers. These people aren't putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers, they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together. If I was to predict the future of this show, I'd say it will go the way of Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will get canceled before it's time and live on in fans' hearts and on DVD.

I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.<br /><br />The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout.

"i have tried almost every italian restaurant that indy has to offer. i've driven past ambrosia multiple times, but i just visited for this first time. i said multiple times throughout my meal that this could be my new favorite italian restaurant. service was impeccable and the food was excellent. i am a huge fan of caesar salads and theirs was delicious! highly recommend if you are from indy or visiting the indy area!",1
"i am visiting out of town. food is surprisingly good. service is so good. prices are, compared to where i live, unbelievably good (or metro nyc area is unbelievably expensive?) after a stressful day, dining here made me feel so good. fries were hot and tasted great. sandwich was good, too. overall, i felt something beyond good food and service: honesty and heart. it's hard to tell objectively why i feel so, but i can recommend this place offers dining experience with reliable quality that is hard to get.",1
went here because of a groupon/living social.  what a treat.  good value and tasty.  local place with awesome sandwiches and great beer selection.  we would go again,1
"i like this location because the employees here can always get my blood drawn efficiently and more importantly, accurately. i have difficult veins and am a ""difficult stick"" so i appreciate when someone can easily find a vein and not have to go through my vein in my hand.

you can make appointments, but it is just as easy to pull up the ap or website and pull up the location to see what the walk-in wait time is going to be. i went when the walk-in wait time was 5 minutes. i arrived, typed my info into the i-pad kiosk, and was seen shortly after that.",1
"my family & i did a take out order (since we aren't comfortable just yet dining at a restaurant) and wow.
we were going to order from chickie & pete's but wanted to support a new local business and we are happy we did. the snow crab we ordered was so fresh, we didn't even need tool to help get the meat from crab legs. we will definitely be ordering there again.  the customer service we received over the phone was great too! our food was ready pretty quick too!",1
of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one,1
wow! came in from out of town and this place has the best lamb chops i've ever tasted. everything was delicious but i can't stop thinking about the lamb chops. the crab cake and oyster appetizers were great. the hash brown bake and broccolini was great as well. i will definitely return here when i come back to visit. i believe our waiter was brian and he was friendly.,1

"Wow... I mean WOW this has got to be one of the best story's I've ever had the chance to read/watch. We all know this famous story. Two martial artist, a man and his son, go to train in the forbidden Cursed Springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each. The dad, Genma, the spring of drowned Panda. And 16 year old Ranma, the spring of drowned girl. Now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in. Crazy enough yet? No, thats just the beginning. As if being one of the strongest teenagers to ever exist who turns into a female wasn't enough, Ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane art styles, an insane high school principle, opponents right and left who have a score to settle with Ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow or for ""stealling"" their loved ones. And speaking of loved ones, I've lost track of how many times a boy or a girl has fallen in love with Ranma. And not once has it been his fiancée, Akane. And thats just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series.<br /><br />The story itself is amazing. I have never come across something so crazy, so bizarre, so... so... out of this world and yet its so down to Earth and believable... I can't even describe it to its fullest. Its just a charming story thats so easy to get into. What I like about it is the humor. Not once have I laughed out loud this much from a manga, and it doesn't have to try any of the stunts you would catch in Simpson's or something of the sort. I could read any part of the comic and I would be laughing from beginning to end. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you would think making him too strong would be a set back but nooo... with every little problem the story throws at him he's doing his best just to survive half the time and his personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst he can be a calculating genius. And to think, of the hundreds of perverts in the show, Ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in his town, more so by Akane, the worst pervert to ever live. His father Genma, you would think the father character would blend in to the background right? Correct! But whenever he does have some spotlight... he just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him! You think you know the worst dad ever from an anime? You haven't met Genma. Ryoga, probably one of Ranma's greatest rivals and my favorite character (next to Ranma)... and probably one of the only people he can actually stand. Most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults, one is his curse that turns him into a baby pig but his worst fault... is his lack of sense in direction! Then we have... you know, I could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters, the story's, everything positive about it but that would be just pointless.<br /><br />Check out the series if you haven't, NOW! You WILL NOT regret it! Though I would advise checking the comic out first. I like the anime, but I've had some trouble getting the series at a good price. And a small nitpick, the humor doesn't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga. I think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me. But either way, its a win win! 10 out of 10!",1
"vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition",1
"Just a comment on New Orleans accents...<br /><br />An earlier reviewer noted the following: ""This film, could have been shot in New York, or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like ""broklynese"" than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country."" There was also another comment along these lines from an English reviewer.<br /><br />Many people in New Orleans do, in fact, sound ""broklynese"". I have never found out why. (It's mentioned in ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" by John Kennedy Toole.) I always appreciate movies taking place in New Orleans that include this detail, as this one did. Too often it's just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent.",1
it has a great atmosphere- definitely feels more like a restaurant than a brewery. rib eye is outstanding. great date place.,1

dee is incredibly skillful and so knowledgeable about eyebrow threading! this was my first time here (i'm a new graduate student at ucsb) and she talked me through what she was seeing and how my eyebrows can improve over time. i've been threading my eyebrows for 6 years and i've never been treated so well at an eyebrow appointment!! she genuinely wants to know about me and shared about her experiences as well. i can't wait to go back!!! i already trust dee with my eyebrows after just one appointment and i can't wait to try her other services like her facials and massages. 100% recommend her for anyone new to the santa barbara area!!,1
"Intelligent, stylish, and compelling thriller from the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films!<br /><br />When troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger, the victim's son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer.<br /><br />Dressed to Kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason. De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense. The finale and conclusion are especially 'nightmarish'.It's a truly edge of your seat shocker. Even more impressive though is De Palma's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic film, but mainly in a strangely beautiful way. Pino Donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film.<br /><br />The cast is another strong feature of this film. Michael Cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as the ill-fated housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as an involved street-walker is solid. A young Keith Gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son.<br /><br />Many criticize De Palma's films for having Hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception. But any similarities between Hitchcocks works and De Palmas can only be seen as a good quality, as calling this film a 'rip-off' would be degrading to a fine thriller. Dressed to Kill is a must see for all cinema fans.<br /><br />**** out of ****",1

"i've recommended pet snobs to a few people and they are happy with them.  people at pet snob are friendly and do a good job.  if i didn't groom my own dog, i'd probably send her to pet snot",1
"lots of food, and taste and i even got a fridge magnet cool!

last week was busy at work, came home and didn't want to leave the sofa, called the fine folks at the restaurant. a new girl took the order and double checked the request. 25 minutes later they were at my door with a big bag of tasties.

i ordered a medium soup, some spring rolls and bbq pork cuts-all were excellent. i tried the lemon chicken and got a free order of pork ribs because the total bill was over 35.00. the chicken rice was also tasty.
still check it out ppl

there was a new older man who dropped it off-so i tipped him 5 bucks so he would remember which apartment i live in- for my next order.

can loose here.",1
