"well after speaking with at least 5 different representatives in the last 10 days i just called to discontinue service 4 days before end of agreement (with verizon). now they want to know what it would take to keep me as a customer!!!
brighthouse just finished new install less than a hour ago. where was this concern for my business last week, and then to add insult to injury they are going to charge me for an early termination of 4 days. got to love the (non) customer service.
and just got back from trying to return equipment to this location......they refused to take it, stating i have to ups it them. 
verizon you had a good thing but you sold us out to this lousy company frontier.
wish yelp would give opportunity to give negative stars.",0

your vet mentioned some things in his review that we spent the time and money on to rule out and your vet mentioned these things in your argument to not pay the claim. so science doesn't apply from what i can tell. i also took the time to have not only the records reviewed by a vet but your vets explanation and he disagreed with your conclusion. if there was any connection your vets explanation wasn't it....your customers speak loudest with their check books. i have cancelled my policy and am happy to move one from pets best!,0

"Idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes Camp Blood (or if you're wanting an awful, badder than bad pun that suits a badder than bad film, ""Camp Bloody awful""), is so bad it's actually quite depressing to watch. And it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film... <br /><br />Awful acting-check. Bad script-check. Tacky effects-check no originality whatsoever-double check. <br /><br />It doesn't even attempt to be different, and is riddled with every predicted cliché imaginable. For example, the film opens to a couple having sex in the woods, so of course they end up dead. <br /><br />One of the most disturbing things is that this film actually spawned two sequels, how and why only baffles the mind. <br /><br />Just stay away from this one.",0
i had high expectations based on how many positive reviews there were but if you are someone who has had vietnamese food in various parts of philly or even just chinatown it's very easy to have bias and realize that while it wasn't pricey food there are other places that give better value for similar cost. overall veggies provided (bean sprouts and in the banh mi) could have been fresher as it felt soggy and lacking in flavor. for the chicken pho the chicken was oddly cut but overall i wish they just provided more protein in the soup. for the banh mi it was a very thick bread and as a result it made the contents feel dry and minimal. maybe if they hollowed out the bread or added more filling it would have been more satisfying. on the positive side the server was really nice and the place was very comfortable and cute so if you are going to order here it's nicer to sit in.,0

"i reallyyy wanted to give this place a good rating but i just can't. so i must say the service was great and venue was good but those were the only good things i could say.   really really disappointed in the food. we are vegetarians and not vegan but we loved v street so decided to give this place a try since everyone raves about it.  first of all, we booked weeks in advance and got the last spot: 9pm. second, the food.  we had the complimentary soup ""shots."" there were prob only 2 teaspoons in the cup and tasted exactly like indian daal. but not a problem since they were complimentary. we had the stuffed avocado first. it was very bland and basically nothing was done to the avocado- just peeled and put on a plate (not even roasted).  the pickled cauliflower on top was just ok.  next we had the roasted maitake mushrooms that didn't honestly have much taste or spice to them.  lastly ordered the fingerling potatoes and egglant. the potatoes were my least favorite- not even any salt or flavoring.  very bland. the egglant was decent but had a little too much rice. after all of that, our bill was already almost $100 that we did not want to get dessert.  again i really wanted to give this a high rating but i just couldn't :(",0

so the iced coffee was warm. melted my ice within seconds and was pre sweetened. the most disgusting thing i have ever tasted. the beignets were flat and heavy and burnt tasting. they failed to put enough powdered sugar to cover the bottom one as if it was the bad child or something. but the music gave me a migraine because it was so loud and that did not matter where you sat. everything was a mess. the sugar container was very clearly empty. i will not be coming back no matter how long the line at cafe du monde.,0
"this movie had a fairly good sounding plot, but the paste was very slow... very slow indeed. even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched.<br /><br />the cinematography is not excellent, but not the worst either. the sounds are OK. lighting OK.<br /><br />i still wouldn't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film-student.<br /><br />the movie does not contain music, and the horses having sex don't make it a good one either. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupid.<br /><br />no winnings here, skip this utter boredom. i've seen worse believe me, but this is just waste of time, and i don't get the good reviews here. especially the high ratings...",0

my mom and i got seated at 1:26pm, 6 other tables had customers, and 5 waitress were visible. we waited 45 min for my scrambled eggs and her salad. no apology from our waitress on the wait, or the fact we had to chase her down for forks. so we hope for the best. my eggs were cold, toast burnt and turkey bacon was  what i was pretty sure was lunch meat. as my mom  was putting her dressing on the salad, she found some dark little hairs on the chicken. my mom walked around with her salad and found the manger and  told the her, who then asked if she wanted a different salad, ""of corse not"", she didn't even ask how my food was. after searching for the waitress, we got our check and left, food still on plates. 
never again and if i didn't have scruples i would have walked out with out paying for what we did eat and drink.",0

"my gf and i went there for the first time friday night. half hour wait as expected, no big deal. excessive noise level, difficult to have a conversation due to the noise. i ordered a italian chicken cutlet sandwich. my gf ordered the lobster roll and we would share an order of onion rings. our drinks were delivered promptly, we then placed our food orders. within five minutes my sandwich arrived. obviously not cooked to order. fifteen minutes later my gf's lobster roll and onion rings arrived. i had finished my sandwich and had to eat alone while waiting for her sandwich. i could not eat my onion rings with my sandwich. my gf enjoyed her lobster roll, my sandwich was just average. the onion rings were very good. this place is over rated. definitely will not go there again!",0
"Begotten is, no doubt, someone's attempt at originality, but, what we have here is art in its most morbid, grotesque form, so, for that, Begotten has my respect, but, to be realistic, it makes no difference what this abomination is about, but for the record...<br /><br />In the ultimate in incoherent horror, we begin in an unknown time, in an unknown place. Right off the bat, we are plunged into the psychotic nightmare that is Begotten, a god is, seemingly depressed, mutilating himself with a razor, I mean, really trying like hell to end it all, it takes a while (why wouldn't it?) After this ultra-morbid introduction, something is happening, something is rising from the corpse, say hello to Mother Earth. What does she do? Well, she gives birth to a thing. The thing would have probably preferred to stay in the womb, but that's life. The psychotic nightmare realm of Begotten welcomes the thing the only way it knows how. The thing, along with Mother Earth is mutilated by unknown, hooded, assailants, with evil intentions being the only clarity available. From this point on, things drag as they've never dragged before. Interesting, grim images, with a totally decent soundtrack, is the high points of the remainder. Not to give the impression that I don't recommend this evilness, because I do, but only once, and only for people with an appreciation for the dark side.<br /><br />From my description, it may appear that I don't ""get"" Begotten. Trust me, I get it, and yes, Begotten is art if I've ever seen it. Everything in this film, regardless of how unrelated it may seem, is significant. That, perhaps, is the only thing that makes Begotten art. With that said, most of us require some form of entertainment value, and this is coming from someone who enjoyed The Chooper. Probably the most intriguing first five minutes, I've seen in a film, but let's be realistic, the next 7 hours and 55 minutes would put one in a coma, that is, unless it's just meant for some kind of psychedelic purposes, in that case, never mind. But, how would one rate such a uniquely boring masterpiece? Depending on how much your attention span can take, It should be either 1 or 10, any other number just wouldn't make a statement. It hurts to do this, but as far as entertainment value goes, Begotten just ain't it. 1/1",0

"I went to see this movie mostly because it looked so good in the trailers. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson should equal greatness. Instead it just continues Williams' bad streak of movies lately. What's wrong with the movie? More like what's right: the ensemble crew does a pretty good job around Robin, and like usual, Christopher Walken is fantastic. That being said, this movie just plain wasn't good. I really only recommend seeing it if you want to see what it would be like if Jon Stewart ran for president and won. Saying he won isn't a spoiler, since it was in the trailer. The concept and idea is really amusing, but that's all. Most of Robin's jokes are just recycled from old comedy bits of his, and there are very few laugh out loud moments, and most are just dumb. Like most comedies that turn out to suck, all of the funny bits are put into the trailer. Really no surprises there, but come on! Some of the movie reads like a Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn novel! People were expecting this to be Robin's return to greatness. Instead, it's more a Flubber.",0
"Where to begin? This film is very entertaining if you are new to the wonderful game of rugby, however, if you live outside the US and do follow the game, it is laughable. Various rugby traditions such as the ""Haka"" which is preformed by the New Zealand ""All Blacks"" and only by the All Blacks. The leader of the Haka is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been misused and represented by the writer. The film itself is quite well directed however it is the poor script and over-all execution that lets it down, heavily. Taking into account is is based on a real story, it does posses a great deal of clichés in the storyline. I would strongly suggest that any American interested in rugby watch this film then watch what rugby actually is on Youtube because the rugby portrayed in this film has been distorted and skewed so far from what it really is.",0

"It's interesting how 90% of the high-vote reviews are all comprised of ""*random username*"" from ""United States"" (no state pride??) who all say more or less the exact same thing with the exact same grammatical style and all with the exact same complete lack of taste in movies. I would delve further into this suspicious trend, but alas, this is a review of the movie, and not the reviews themselves.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I am both a Christian and a true avid movie fan. This means I have seen a great many movies, from good to bad, and can wholeheartedly claim that Facing The Giants is, in fact, NOT a good movie. It has good intentions, but fails to meet many (if any) basic standards that I associate with a quality filmgoing experience.<br /><br />The Acting: Mostly Terrible, Palatable At Best. Hearing that most were apparently volunteers does not at all surprise me.<br /><br />The Dialogue: Clumsy, cheesy, the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit you'd see performed in Sunday School or youth group function. The Rave Review Robots revel in the absence of ""meaningless words"", but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world, and the complete absence of it is palpable. Let's just say the mean ol' head coach of a team in a State Championship game would have a lot more to say than ""OH NO!"" when things are not going his way.<br /><br />The Plot: Mind-bogglingly predictable. It has been commented that this movie is ""not a Hollywood cliché"", and yet it's like it was pulled directly from Making An Underdog Sports Movie For Dummies (including the mandatory quasi-romantic subplot for the ladies) and just had a Christian-themed coat of paint slapped on it. I'm not lying or bragging when I say I had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot pegged immediately upon their inception. Only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally stirred by the story presented here.<br /><br />The Directing/Editing: It, too, was patterned almost exactly after the generic Underdog Sports Movie template. Still, acting aside, there weren't many noticeable goofs, so at least Facing The Giants was technically competent.<br /><br />The Message: Ask Jesus and He will grant all your wishes. Part of me hoped that this movie would end in the team's eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole ""If we lose, we praise You"" part, because in the Real World, you WILL fail at one point or another and it's good to be prepared for that. But in the world of Facing The Giants, if you fail, clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating. Another interesting question being, what if the Eagles came across another team that had gotten religion? Would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and last-minute saves, or would the universe simply have exploded? <br /><br />The Bottom Line: For the hardcore conservative Christian Parents crowd lamenting the evils of Hollywood, Facing The Giants will be another mediocre-at-best Christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern film-making. For everyone else, the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else. And a warning: Any attempt to show this to non-Christians will lead not to conversion, but to derision. I give this two stars, one for the one scene that did not have me rolling my eyes, and another for basic technical proficiency on a low budget.",0
"overall, it was a huge disappointment. the food was fine-good,  but when the service is so bad to make you forget about the food, it's never a good thing.

first, we were only offered a drink when we first sat down, and no one else came back to ask if we would have liked another after we finished round one. then, the server that took our order never even came back to the table. they forgot a course we ordered and had it on the check until we said otherwise. never once did ""sorry"" come out of anyone's mouth or offer the missing dish to us.

overall, the food was b+ - a- range and the service an f. will not go back for dinner",0
"Personally, I didn't really gain a whole lot from THE ACT OF SEEING WITH ONE'S OWN EYES. I've noticed a lot of really highly rated reviews on here for the film, and I'm kinda surprised. Maybe I missed something that other reviewers felt ""moved"" by but I found the film pretty tedious and basically pointless.<br /><br />The ""action"" of the film is a bunch of autopsy footage that is filmed in an ""art-house"" style - lots of extreme close-ups, weird editing, etc...and with no sound or dialogue.<br /><br />I guess THE ACT OF SEEING WITH ONE'S OWN EYES could be considered a study of human anatomy, or maybe (if you really wanna dig a little) some sort of comment on the fragility of humanity or whatever - but I personally found it to be a bunch of semi-interesting but ultimately dull autopsy footage. If that's your thing, then this will be a winner for you. As for me - I've seen more interesting ER footage. Not a ""bad"" film, as it isn't really a ""film"" in any traditional sense - I just found nothing really notable about it - 4/10.",0

"This movie is based on the series Street Fighter Alpha (or Zero)! It is placed in an other setting than Streetfighter the animated movie! This movie is all about Ryu who is accompanied by Ken and Chun Li. I recognized Rose,Zanghief and Birdie! There weren't any other characters used from the video game (that i could discover)! The fighting scenes were OK but nothing really spectacular! And there were not many of them! To me this is odd! Isn't Streetfighter about fighting! Streetfighter the animated movie (1994) is far superior to this movie. It tries to be more than it really is! The use of the ""Hada Power"" and other supernatural elemnents have nothing to do with skills the characters have in the video game! And in this case that is a bad thing! The story is so boring that you don't really care what is happening! The action is toned down considerably! Why? And what happened to the other characters from the video game! Surely they are more interesting than the villain in this story! The main attraction of the video game are the characters with their own special skills! In this movie it is all about Ryu! That is why this anime fails!",0

"had our rehearsal dinner there last week. we were told they would do a gluten free meal for us (my nephew and sister have celiacs). we got there and the nasty waitress just shrugged her shoulders and said ""we don't do that."" at least be polite and apologize. she was literally so rude the entire night. the rest of the wait staff were ok. it was suppose to be a happy event and we had 40 people there so they were making good money. the food was ehh. risotto is just rice, not risotto. so disappointed :(",0
"i had to give this place a one star.  a group of 6 of us were eating in and the service was terrible.  it was an hour to get our salads and an hour and 20 minutes to get the main courses.  i spoke to several people, the server admitted he was afraid to ask the kitchen where our food was. the salads were warm and the entrees luke warm but we were so hungry we ate them anyway.  part of the problem is, i believe, the take out seems to be a priority and the eat in a second thought or maybe third or fourth.  sorry i like to support local but just sorry, sorry and no discount or explanation other than we are busy is not good enough.  never going back.",0
yelp failed me tonight. no idea how this restaurant gets 4! stars. the restaurant is next to my hotel so i could walk next door. had chargrilled oysters for appetizer and they were less than 1/2 size of a penny. no thanks. i'm from louisiana so i thought i would try the gumbo. no. tasted like barbecue soup. nasty. (now i give them props that my server took it off my check when he saw i didn't eat more than a couple of bites.) i also had the fried green tomatoes with shrimp remoulade. the fried green tomatoes were pretty good but the shrimp wasn't even cooked and it definitely wasn't a remoulade sauce. i am generous with the 1 star and the only reason they got that is because i could at least eat the fried green tomatoes.,0

"sadly, today was our last visit to the griddle. overpriced food, very bitter coffee, portions are getting smaller and smaller and it's very hit and miss on getting your food to your table hot, or even warm. when we first moved here we loved this place. not so much anymore. the quality of the food isn't consistent and service can be very hit or miss. there are better, more reasonably priced breakfast places in meridian and boise which we will be going to from now on.

"everyone was really friendly, but they sold me a car that i had to put $1200 of repairs into the next day. i normally have cars checked out before i buy them, but they were too far away to take the car to my mechanic, and my mechanic said the car was dangerous to drive. so i asked if they could just fix the scratch in the side of the door to offset the expense i had to put into the car. 

when we started the sales process the salesperson said i could bring it back to have that fixed - that the detailer just ran out of time before i came in. but then when i went to sign the papers, his boss said no to fixing the scratch. when i just asked them to do that, in good faith, his boss said no again. 

so i went from thinking the dealership was amazing to not ever trusting or using them again over a repair that probably would have cost them under $100. that's not the kind of business i want to work with. and i wouldn't recommend anyone to take a risk with them either.",0

"this review is long overdue. i reserved a room here through a third party website a few months in advance of my planned overnight stay. my hotel room was supposed to include a queen-sized bed to accommodate two people. when we finally got to the hotel, my boyfriend dropped me off so that i could check in and then head to the made in america festival afterwards. when i got to the front desk, they told me that no rooms with queen-sized beds were available and that instead they have reserved a room with a ""pull-out"" for me. i was a little confused because this is the first time in my lifetime that i have ever had an issue with a hotel reservation. in fact, in the past, i have been pleasantly surprised with hotel room upgrades. i'm originally from los angeles and have stayed in several hotels throughout the united sates and around the world. never have i had a hotel tell me, ""i'm sorry, but the room you reserved and received confirmation of reservation for is no longer available."" apparently there was an issue with rain that day that caused them to have less occupancy. yet, they did not even have the courtesy to contact me ahead of time to warn me that my room was going to be ""downgraded"" if that is even a way to describe what they did. after my boyfriend parked the car and came inside, i told him what happened. he was not happy. i am a pretty laid-back and flexible person in general, so i didn't even take the time to consider that this incident could have been stemmed by discrimination. however, my s.o. pointed out that the very likely reason that my room was downgraded was due to my spanish last name. he said that this is a common thing seen in this part of the country. they see a last name like mine and think, ""she doesn't know what nice things are."" i went into the room to lay down on the ""pull-out"" and my boyfriend points out that our room is just an extension portion of a regular room. the pull-out bed is by no means anything close to what a regular mattress feels like to lie down on. the phone rings shortly and my bf answers. the front desk calls to ask if everything is okay and he says, ""no, everything is not okay. this is not acceptable."" they called to check in because they saw me and realized that my appearance did not match what they believed a person with my last name would look like. i realized that my s.o. was right and felt surprised, angry, and disappointed that we had to experience this. thankfully, he had family and friends nearby where we were able to sleep and relax much more comfortably. i told the front desk to cancel my reservation and to issue me a refund because why the #$%! would i spend $$$ to rest on a cheap *@^ sofa mattress. absolutely disrespectful, unacceptable and a disgrace. they deserve zero stars! beware!!!",0

also, as we were leaving i noticed that they record us at our table. i asked the hostess at the door and she said this was so the owner can watch his staff?? recorded with my hubby at our dinner table??? can't say i enjoy this at all and we will not be coming back.

great message from chef ben.. i took some time to read all your other reviews.. great job responding to your customers... wait.. after your responses they are no longer your customers. paranoid i am not, but when i get a night out with my husband without my children i'd like to have a private conversation and not have to be worried that i'm being recorded at my table. being recorded in the establishment is one thing but being recorded at my table is another.

anyways, lemmie preface this rivi by stating i will indeed go back, as i hope the kids in the back figure out how to cook burgers. 

this place, i know is a chain, but for where it is in carmel has real potential. the ambiance, the layout, and the brews are just freaking awesome. i can kinda see why they are located where they are, as parking is ample. parking on any late week night, or weekend in carmel is every bit as bad as broad ripple. so they got that goin for them, which is nice.

on to the meat and potatoes. as you can see from the pics i posted (yes i realize we got carry out, but that shouldn't excuse why they under cooked a simple burger) the meat was waaaaay under cooked. we normally don't have an issue with this, but the wife, being preggers is supposed to not eat rare meat. c'mon bru, did you not teach the staff in the back the palm temp trick???

the fries, however, were freaking fantastic. and as i said, the brews that they have on tap are in abundance. and lastly, the staff. bang on. i have no doubt if we were there and asked the bar keep to throw 'em on the grill a lil longer he would've been more than willing. outstanding service!

we will give this place another shot, but upon first impression, not good. if you want a medium burger, make sure they understand you mean medium, not rare.

"It really amazed me to see that someone would take so much time to assess such a bad movie. The beginning (of the film) had some truth in it. The Partisan ""AF"" was started in 1943 when two communist pilots from the Croat Ustashi AF deserted, together with their observers, in Breguet 19 and Potez 33, respectively. The aircraft saw some action in strafing and hand-bombing, but didn't last very long. One crew was killed and the other survived, the pilot being killed later while flying a Spitfire Vc. The real Partisan squadrons were established when RAF detached two of its (Yugoslav) squadrons of Spitfire Vc and, Hurricane IIc , respectively, manned by Ex Yugoslav Royal Airforce pilots, and allotted them to Tito's forces on the Island of Vis. Even those were never engaged in air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. So the film was one giant cow manure, to put it mildly, and the lowest point for its, otherwise not at all bad, director. By some quirk of fate I was present on the filming of the last sequence of the movie, when dozens of German aircraft were destroyed (Yugoslav 522 trainers, used also in the flying sequences) on the Mostar military airport. The pyrotechnics were impressive, and the Scotch served lavishly by the film crew was even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameless lie was and frequently joked about by the contemporary audience.",0
made a reservation through opentable for 5. they crammed us in a booth next to a couple so we basically dined with not one but 2 couples because our food took forever. our orders were all messed up but it took almost 2 hours for food so we ate it anyway. waitress was super nice def. seemed like kitchen issues. mgr. took a portion of our bill off and gave a gift card. profusely apologized to my husband. poor waitress seemed at her wits end. not going back.,0
"very very slow and poor service. food delivered was incorrect and server indicated that the food runner couldn't be tracked down to correct it. definitely did not have a customer is always right attitude. i very seldom complain or have issues with service but this was extremely poor experience. by no means was there southern hospitality experienced from staff. 

the live classic country music was very nice and enjoyable. 

food is ok but not exceptional. i like simple food which the menu is primarily comprised of. 

i am not sure whether i would ever give this place another try. if i did, i would likely sit at the bar.

i have come here multiple times over the years with multiple different vehicles, and they usually do a fair job for a decent price. i have brought other quotes from other mechanics, that i knew were over charging, and they beat the price. however, on this experience they seriously tried to take advantage of me. i dropped my 03 ranger off at 7:30 in the morning to have my oil changed and my coolant pressure checked because my fluid levels were low. i was called back around 10:30 and given a long list and an over complicated description of what was wrong. in that list they told me they had to do a special order a part  (heater hose assembly kit)  from fords manufacturer because there was no auto parts place in they county who had one and that it would be $225 and $121 in labor for a total of $377.99 after tax. well unfortunately for them i am actually slightly familiar with ford engines having pulled to out and completely re-built them in the past.  i called them on their bs and told them not to do it. i did give them permission to replace my thermostat which took them from 10:30 am to 5:30 pm, so they are clearly efficient in what they do (thats sarcasm for those who don't know thats a 30 min job). after that i got my truck back and went literally 2 miles down the road to napa auto parts and bought the ""super special part"" for $39 and replaced it myself (all you do is screw on 3 house claps). i brought my truck here out of convenience because i work full-time and go to school full-time and did not feel like doing the work myself. needless to say these buffoons will never get another penny from me.",0

"Without being really the worst science fiction film ever made, or the worst I have seen, 'Time Under Fire' is still much under average. The premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not that bad, it starts as a X-Files story, combining Bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel. Pretty soon elements of other genres (too many) mix together, but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a TV series. Soon, 'Time Under Fire' quickly degenerates into a series of clichés, not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being unable to create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow.

But 'Mamma Mia' - utter, utter cr**. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this film is just terrible. The stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another, no characterisation, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the DVD) are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen, the dance chorus of north Europeans appear on a small Greek island at will, while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced Cliff Richard's musicals in the sixties!Meryl (see me I'm acting)Streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical!

The camera cannot stop moving like bad MTV. One can never settle down and just enjoy the music, enthusiasm and characters.

spicy soup was good. 
the condiments that are usually offered for free in japan, you have to pay for which kind of surprised me. 
we ordered a side order of chicken gyouza and that was good stuff!

"Songwriter Robert Taylor (as Terry) is ""dizzy, slap-happy"" and can't see straight over otherworldly Norma Shearer (as Consuelo). ""She makes the sun shine, even when it's raining,"" Mr. Taylor explains. But, Mr. Taylor gets a lump in his throat whenever he gets near Ms. Shearer. Finally, at the Palm Beach casino Shearer frequents, Taylor proclaims ""I love you!"" Shearer brushes him off, as she is engaged to George Sanders (as Tony). However, to settle a gambling debt, Shearer hires Taylor to pose as ""Her Cardboard Lover"", to make Mr. Sanders jealous.<br /><br />This film's title invites the obvious and appropriate three-word review: ""Her Cardboard Movie"". It is most notable as the last film appearance for Shearer, one of the biggest stars in the world from ""He Who Gets Slapped"" (1924, playing another Consuelo) to ""The Women"" (1939). To be fair, this was likely the kind of Shearer film MGM believed audiences wanted to see. However, the part is unflattering.<br /><br />Plucked and powered, Taylor and Shearer were better off in ""The Escape"" (1940). If Shearer had continued, she might have become a better actress than ""leading lady""; apparently, she was no longer interested, and certainly didn't need the money. Taylor has a great scene, reciting Christina Rossetti's ""When I am Dead, My Dearest"" while threatening to jump from Shearer's balcony, as directed by George Cukor.<br /><br />**** Her Cardboard Lover (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders",0

There are some nice Brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable, but the story of how they interrelate, even if very unusual by our standards, is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long. The central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first. As the tolerance of the various men is stretched, we see their characters develop. The story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting. It is a rare glimpse into the Brasilian hinterland, far from the city, but hardly exciting enough to keep one's eyes open for.",0

"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** There must have been something in the air in the immediate postwar years that made night cities attractive settings for movies. A gaggle of nocturnal, urban films were made at that time, and not just in America. One of the most notable was Carol Reed's Odd Man Out, an English picture about a wounded gunman staggering through the streets of Belfast. In America it was the high noon, or more properly, high midnight, of film noir.<br /><br />Crossfire isn't really film noir, but has the trappings of noir, though it uses them for its own aims, which have to do with bigotry. Directed by Edward Dmytryk, written by John Paxton, it was adapted from a novel by Richard Brooks. The book concerned the murder of a homosexual; in the movie the victim is changed to a Jew. Though filmed like a mystery there is little suspense in the film, as it is fairly obvious who the murderer is early on. What makes the film so watchable and beautiful is its evocation of a city, Washington, D.C., just after World War II, by some of the most gifted craftsmen working in films at that time. Unlike many night movies Crossfire is set mostly indoors: in police stations, rooming houses and all-night movie theaters. Soldiers are everywhere in the film, and most are itching to get back to their civilian lives. Yet one senses, from most of the men we meet, that their personalities have been so shaped by their military experience it's going to be tough for them to return to their old neighborhoods; for some maybe even impossible. They seem more bound to one another than to anything or anyone else.<br /><br />Yet some men never truly bonded with anyone in the military. The murderer, Monty, is one such individual. One senses that he was never connected in his civilian life, either. He is a lone wolf who also needs people. Desperately alone, he has a sadistic streak a mile wide, and always needs someone nearby to be the butt of his jokes. The man he kills did him no harm, and was in fact a stranger to him. But once Monty figured out the man's religion, that was enough. He didn't really mean to kill the guy, as it was his intent to 'merely' humiliate him and just beat him up. But as he was quite drunk at the time, Monty's fists got the better of him. It is this act that sets the story the story in motion.<br /><br />Once the movie builds up a head of steam the other characters come rapidly into focus. Monty's opposite number is Keely, another soldier, who, though introspective like Monty, and somewhat detached, harbors no resentment toward anyone and seems a reasonable, even amiable guy. Finley, the pipe-smoking homicide detective, is dandyish and a tad effete compared to the men in uniform, but proves more than a match for the various and mostly recalcitrant soldiers he deals with. The actors who plays these roles, Roberts Ryan, Mitchum and Young, give excellent performances, each in a different key. Ryan, as Monty, is tense and paranoid, always looking around for someone to pick on; and one can feel his anxiety over becoming a victim himself. As Keely, Mitchum is low-key, almost nonchalant; he never raises his voice; and he seems to have more to say, more to offer, than is permitted by the script. Young's performance has often been criticized as being too soft, but I find it deceptively strong and nicely offbeat. He cuts against the stereotype of the hardboiled cop, and makes the character of Finley a bit of a prince of crime detection.<br /><br />There are few surprises in Crossfire, though the script is at times surprisingly well-written, even brilliant. Character actor Paul Kelly gives one of the best short performances in the movies as the 'boyfriend' of a woman a soldier picks up in a bar. Kelly may or may not be her husband; and he may or may not live with her, though he seems relaxed enough in her apartment. The beauty of these scenes are that nothing is made clear, and this man himself seems more than a little confused over what his role is, was or ought to be. In a way these few scenes form the thematic core of the film, which is anomie. With the exception of the detective all the men in the film are drifting, aimless and basically lost, some more seriously than others. In this respect Crossfire is, for all the preaching near the end, a film about the vagueness of identity, and how easily it can be lost or warped. Men drift from one bar to another in this film, as they engage in a sort of woozy camaraderie, their personalities merging into a kind of general American male template. Then something happens, something is nailed down. A word is mentioned, whether 'Jew' or 'hillbilly', and things suddenly turn tense, and the very notion of individuality, of an identity outside the group, of anyone not like them, becomes deeply offensive, even loathsome. Then, after tempers flare and whatever stirred them up has been resolved or forgotten, the men revert to their loose, non-personal group normality, and order is restored.",1

It takes a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back in the day (perhaps these days they have gotten just abit smarter).

"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.<br /><br />The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard. This causes some deceased, buried in the Catholic churchyard, to now be in the Protestant north - and so the local priest, assisted by a wide variety of eccentric locals, aims to move the bodies back undercover of darkness, and so avoiding the bureaucratic British border guards.<br /><br />It was inspired work to cast the Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes to play the part of Madigan. He brings an innocence to the part, especially in his to-camera pieces (which is normally where he interacts with the voiceover of Richard Attenborough, playing supposedly the writer/director of the film). Daragh O'Malley playing Father Rudden is also worthy of considerable praise; and the rest of the cast, from the household names like Elliott Gould and Griff Rhys Jones to people with what would normally be called 'bit parts' - such as Spike's daughter Jane who plays Madigan's wife give 100% The credit for this goes, in no small part, to the wonderful characterisations given by Spike in the original book.<br /><br />I could argue that the film is slightly too long, or that Elliott Gould's Irish accent left a little to be desired, but those would be only minor points and take nothing away from the excellence of this film.",1
"Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, this is the great actor's anti-Nazi propaganda piece, skewering Adolf Hitler.<br /><br />Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, the dictator of Tomania, as well as a Jewish barber who is Hynckel's spitting image. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen newsreels of Hitler speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature. <br /><br />I thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical Chaplin slap-stick focussing on the First World War adventures of the Jewish barber. Having never seen it before I must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so I was wondering what all the fuss was about. But the movie picks up steam quickly. There are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of ""Hynckel-ism"" to make the propaganda point. The climax of the film is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech given by Chaplin at the end of the movie.<br /><br />As good as Chaplin is in this movie, though, I thought the whole thing was stolen by Jack Oakie, playing the dictator of ""Bacteria"" - ""Benzino Napaloni."" Our first look at Oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had Mussolini's arrogant posturing down pat. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni negotiate over the fate of ""Osterlich"" had me in stitches.<br /><br />This was a very good movie, and well worth watching.",1

"Here's my first David Mamet directed film. Fitting, since it was his first, as well. <br /><br />The story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie, from the little cons to the big cons to the all-encompassing con. It's like ""The Grifters,"" but without that film's level of acting. (In that film, John Cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character.) The acting here is very flat (I sometimes wondered if the bland acting by Crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis). At least in the beginning. It never gets really good, but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. Early in the film, some of Lindsay Crouse's lines -- the way she reads them -- sound as if they're inner monologue or narration, which they aren't. With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up.<br /><br />The dialogue here isn't as fun as it should be. I was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue, but these ones don't. It all sounds very read, rather than spoken. Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words. He's far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. What's more strange is that other than this, the film doesn't look or feel like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. Everything flowed.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines -- or even play characters speaking play lines -- but here it sounds like movie (or even book) characters speaking play lines. It's a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn't work. That doesn't mean the movie is bad -- it isn't, it's often extremely entertaining. The best chunk is in the middle.<br /><br />It's standard con movie stuff: the new guy (in this case, girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the seedy con underworld. How she gets involved is: she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help him out with his gambling debt, so she walks into The House of Games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room. I'll admit the setup is pretty improbable. (Were they just expecting Crouse to come in? Were they expecting she'd write a cheque? Was Billy in on it? One of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.)<br /><br />And from here the cons are start to roll out. I found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun. We're getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as Crouse is. <br /><br />We see the ending coming, and then we didn't see the second ending coming, and then the real ending I didn't see coming but maybe you did. The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse walked into The House of Games she found her true calling.<br /><br />I'm going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it. After the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going. If you want a fun con movie, then here she is. If you want Mamet, go watch ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" again -- James Foley did him better.<br /><br />***",1

"Meatballs has been a main staple in my family for over 26 years! We saw this movie when it first came out and have seen it dozens of times since. Bill Murray is at his best and is most touching in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely pre-teen boy and befriends him, while leading his CIT's into once mischievous scheme after another! The cast of characters are fun and zany and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other. This is not another sleazy, dumb, teen sex-fest. It is funny and sweet and just all-around fun. Anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves. It is a must-see. Watch out for Spaz - he is by far the best character! (Especially during the camp social - while Bill Murray hams it up for the camera - just watch Spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he picks to dance with!) By far, one of my very favorite comedies of all time!",1
"Story about a widowed father (Claude Rains) bringing up his four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is loved by big hunky Ernest (Dick Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is romanced by an old but wealthy man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to become a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is a romantic. Drop dead handsome Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), a business associate of their father, comes to stay with them. All the sisters fall in love with him. Then tough cynical Mickey (John Garfield) enters the picture...<br /><br />Very entertaining movie was a big hit and nominated for five Academy Awards. It's beautifully directed by Michael Curitz, has a pretty good (if predictable) script and a VERY attractive cast (especially Lynn). Also this was John Garfield's first film and made him a star. This was so popular there were three or four sequels (which I never saw). This is an engrossing, entertaining, big budget soap opera--well worth seeing.",1

dogme,1
"As a former Highland Rugby(HR) player, I feel like I can possibly answer some of the questions and confusion that has been put forward. I think that I am also in a position to offer some insight into the club and back stories. Oh, and this is gonna be a long post, I can tell already.<br /><br />First off, the people who said that the movie doesn't show real rugby, have a valid point. The movie is full of bad tackles, people in the wrong places, and much much more. If you want to know what a real rugby game feels like, you won't get the best idea from this movie. But the thing is, anything short of actually sitting down and watching a highlight reel or jumping into a game yourself, is not going to be satisfactory. It's Hollywood, not ESPN! Really, how many sports movies really make you feel like you are in the game? Not many that I have seen. I think it's important to keep in mind that the movie is about rugby players, much more than it is about rugby.<br /><br />Next, the Haka is VERY much a part of Highland Rugby. It is not something that they just threw into the movie. To be honest, I don't know how the tradition got started, but Highland emulates the All Blacks in many ways. The uniform is based off of the All Blacks as well. The movie did not do a good job of explaining the origins of the Haka, and to be honest, I don't think that that is right. But I can tell you that every member of the team knows exactly where it comes from and what it means. As for the person from China(?) who said that only a Maori can perform a Haka, I would suggest that they take a look at the All Blacks and tell me if they think that they are all Maori. Believe it or not, Utah has a very large Polynesian community, and a good portion of them like and play rugby for the local teams. I, myself am part Hawaiian. Whenever possible, the Haka is led by a Maori. The team does not do it because they think that they are Maori, they do it because of some of the issues shown in the movie. The concept of unity and ""those who have gone before"" is a huge part of the HR culture, and the message behind the Haka, for any of those that are familiar with it, support those values. It's a chant by a chief who thought he would die (Ka Mate), and those around him supporting him telling him he will live (Ka Ora) and boosting him up. How appropriate it is for a bunch of white boys to do it is not for me to say, but that is the ideology behind it and why it is done. ""Kia Kaha"" is also a well used team motto, even if the actors had a hard time saying it.<br /><br />Also, for the people who questioned Highland's Rugby playing ability, I would just remind you that you were not really watching Highland play in this movie. Many of the extras were former players from Highland and other teams, but the main characters were all actors. Believe it or not, Highland really is pretty good at what they do and pretty well respected in the international community. Granted, some years produce better teams than others (it's what you would expect with any sports team), but you don't accumulate HR's win record by just being okay. The year after I graduated, (1998) Highland was one of 12 teams to be invited to the World Schools Rugby Championship in Zimbabwe. The teams were hand picked from around the world and represented the best of High school rugby talent at the time. Highland obviously didn't win first place, (New Zealand did that), but they did manage to take third place in the tournament, beating the Tongan national champions in their last match. And while American rugby may never reach the level of talent that New Zealand or South Africa has, third in the world is also nothing to hang your head about. Highland also has a tradition of touring New Zealand every few years, and usually comes back with more wins than losses.<br /><br />The majority of characters portrayed in this movie are based off of real people and real stories. I watched this movie with my brothers, who also played for Highland, and between the four of us, we were fairly certain that we were able to identify ALMOST every main character. Nobody knew a white Rasta. Of course as this wasn't a documentary, Hollywood did take some liberties, but to tell you the truth, not as many as you might think. The film was actually pretty accurate in showing the 2 and a half hour daily practices, as well as the mandatory personal running and weight training. Sometimes it really was running until you threw up. It also showed the service and other team activities (like the chuck-a-rama buffet) that were very much a part of team bonding.<br /><br />And finally the movie, in my (obviously very biased) opinion, it was a pretty good movie. And I think that the reason for it is that I watched it as an inspirational sports movie. I didn't think that it would be a pure rugby movie or an academy award winning drama. It was just an uplifting movie about a rugby team, complete with morals, encouragement, and a good dose of jokes thrown in for entertainment. I hope that I addressed some of the problems that people have had with the movie, and hope that you can now enjoy it for what it was.<br /><br />Kia Kaha",1

"I am stunned at the negative comments that I have read and can only assume that the people making such comments were less than honest. This is the most moving and real portrayal of Joseph Smith that I have ever seen. It was well acted to the point that at times I forgot that I was watching a movie. It brought Joseph's life of hardship, good-natured optimism, enduring faith in people and God, and ultimate sacrifice to life such in a way that frankly left me speechless and silent in awe. If anyone, of ANY Christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in some positive way--I would have to say it is a reflection of the individual and NOT the movie. I give the movie a ""10"" and encourage honest souls to view it. At the very LEAST it is an extremely heart felt portrayal of man who gave everything he had for what he believed...In a world where values and beliefs are ridiculed, this movie stands as a enduring reminder of the kind of people we are supposed to be- no matter what religious beliefs we hold.- Ann Pruitt-",1

"Back when musicals weren't showcases for choreographers, we had wonderful movies such as this one.<br /><br />Being a big fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire I was delighted to finally see this movie. Not quite a blend of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the American vaudeville humour, the slapstick not the witty banter, clash with Wodehouse's British sense of humour. But on the whole, the American style banter makes the American characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures.<br /><br />Some inventive staging for the dance numbers, including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors, more than make up for the lack of a Busby Berkley over the top dance number. They seem a lot more realistic, if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic.<br /><br />The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore don't hurt the movie, instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge. It's also nice not to have a wise cracking, headstrong love interest. Instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest, far more in keeping with Wodehouses' young aristocratic females.",1

"Scientist Carl Lehman (well played by David McIlwraith) gets blown up something terrible in a deliberate chemical explosion. He has his brain transplanted in the body of a nearly indestructible metal cyborg suit by his evil colleagues who are led by wicked obsessive fellow scientist Alex Whyte (a perfectly hateful portrayal by Richard Cox). Lehman embarks on an all-out killing spree. It's up to nasty mercenary Hunter (a wonderfully loathsome turn by the divine Pam Grier) to put a stop to him. Director Jean-Claude Lord, who previously helmed the under-appreciated slasher psycho thriller ""Visiting Hours,"" stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable verve and maintains a zippy pace throughout, thus ensuring that this flick sizes up as an enjoyably trashy sci-fi/horror action outing. Paunchy character thesp Maury Chaykin easily cops top acting honors as disgusting fat creep Burt, who in the movie's single most tasteless sequence has a brutal fistfight with Lehman's pregnant wife Lauren (a winning performance by the lovely Teri Austin). Stan Winston's nifty make-up f/x and Paul Zaza's thrilling score further add to the overall sleazy fun.",1
reworks,1
"<br /><br />This film has some really impressive action scenes. The humor and action are blended well, though the intensity of the film does not sustain itself till the end. The last scene is a slight anti-climax in terms of action quality and astonishing explosiveness of the scenes preceding it. The humor doesn't seem to be so ridiculously clumsy as in many other Hongkong movies, and this film is of totally other class than most American action-comedies of recent years. Lau Ching-Wan acts as a typical, intuitive police-hero who scoffs at invalid orders from incompetent police superiors. The dialectic of the film is built on the superhuman coolness and ruthlessness of the drug gang, humiliating the police force while providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with a variety of machine guns. Leaving plenty of corpses in it's wake. Yu Rong-Guang is especially impressive as an ultra cool, merciless gangster in this Woo-like piece of action where tough guys are truly die-hard.",1
"a friend and i went for dinner prior to a recording session at my studio, which is down the block on 104 st. we have eaten in most of the restaurants on the block, but there are always new places turning up.
when i first moved to this street 21 years ago, 104st was a wasteland of surface parking lots and just 1 restaurant.
it was also where you came to buy crack, but i digress...
in those 2 decades i have watched 104 st turn into the most vibrant street in edmonton, and the dining choices have increased exponentially.

we walked north down the street trying to figure where we would dine, and when we saw dosc (drunken ox, sober cat) we realised neither of us had been there under this incarnation.
we had visited rick's grill more than once, and were expecting something similar.
we were mistaken.
dosc is a beautifully appointed space, anchored by 2 large service islands, the first serving coffee (sober cat) and the second a well set up cocktail bar. (drunken ox)
the lovely young lady who greeted us at the door seated us quickly and efficiently, and we had not been in our places more than a few seconds when our server showed up with menus.

we were expecting burgers and such, but we found ourselves in a high end steak house. ironically, neither of us actually wanted steak.
fortunately the ""non-steak"" choices are excellent and having ordered ourselves local microbrew beverages, i ordered braised duck breast served with root vegetables and my associate the pan seared sea bass, on a bed of navy beans.

it is important to note, that the dinner menu here is short, and it is pricey. mine was one of the least expensive entrees on the menu, at $34.00, the fish, about the same.
the steaks look really good, but are also top end.

our dishes arrived, and we tucked in.
my duck breast was two decent pieces of duck, with 3 grilled roots vegetables. i want to say parsnips, or a specialty carrot (i did not take notes, and cannot find the menu we got online.) along with several chunks of potato.
the duck was perfectly cooked and delicious, as were the potatoes. the mystery tubers were unique and visually pleasing, but the taste did little for me. they had an almost chemical aftertaste to my palate.

my buddy's sea bass was perfectly cooked, but the big winner was the navy bean roulade it was served on. it was the most sumptuously delicious part of the meal.

the food at dosc is superb and the skill of the cooks beyond reproach. the service is also top notch, and i would say dosc has the highest ratio of servers to customers i have seen in this town, all professional and courteous. the restaurant itself is beautiful and well laid out, and the washrooms are clean enough you could eat in them. (don't...)

i would like to try out their cafe section for breakfast or lunch, sometime. the prices seem more reasonable, and the food choices more up my alley.
i would even return for dinner, if only to load the table with amazing sounding appetizers.",1

"The very first talking picture has returned from oblivion, and now you can hear it and see it! In autumn of 1894, at the Edison lab complex in West Orange, New Jersey, Thomas Edison's associate William Dickson tried to combine two existing technologies (the phonograph and the kinetoscope) to record sound and image together. In the event, Dickson was unable to synchronise the playback of sound and image, so this experimental film was never released to paying audiences ... and consequently (unlike many silent films which Dickson made for Edison at this time) it has no official title. The silent image (recorded at 40 fps) has been in the Library of Congress for years, known to film historians as a mute curiosity. It was also known that the 'soundtrack' had been recorded on one of the crude wax cylinders languishing at the Edison National Historic Site ... although nobody knew which one.<br /><br />But now that's changed. Recently, curators located the wax cylinder, which had broken into several pieces. These were reassembled: a playback was obtained, and the sound was digitised. Hollywood's veteran soundtrack editor Walter Murch cleaned up the background noise and tweaked the digitisation to make it synch with the film image, which Murch had digitally compressed to 30 fps. Sound and image are synchronised at last!<br /><br />The film begins with an offscreen man's voice calling: 'The rest of you fellows ready? Go ahead!' (The unseen speaker remains unidentified, but was probably Dickson's assistant Fred Ott.) On screen, Dickson plays a violin into an immense funnel mounted on a tripod (one of Edison's sound-recording devices) while alongside him, in full view of the camera, two male lab assistants embrace each other for some quick ballroom dancing to the tempo of Dickson's music.<br /><br />The film lasts barely 17 seconds: just long enough for us to marvel at this crude technology before being provoked to laughter at the sight of two men waltzing in each other's arms. Speaking of which, here's a WARNING: a well-known but extremely inaccurate reference book ('The Celluloid Closet', by the late Vito Russo) includes a frame enlargement from this movie and identifies it as 'The Gay Brothers'. That's incorrect. 'The Gay Brothers' is an entirely different movie, made by Dickson at the Edison lab during this same period. 'The Gay Brothers' never had a soundtrack: it's a brief fiction film about two brothers who are NOT 'gay' in the sense Russo meant it. The deceased Mr Russo, for his own reasons, wanted us to perceive Dickson's experimental sound film (arguably the first movie musical!) as an artefact of 19th-century homoeroticism. (Hmm, what is it about gay men and musicals?) Sorry, but there's just no such content here.<br /><br />This vitally important film deserves a rating of 10 out of 10. I've often maintained that no 'lost' movie should ever be considered irretrievable unless it was deliberately destroyed: I'm delighted to report that this film is finally available to audiences as its producer intended it, more than a century after it was filmed!",1

"I just saw this movie for the second time. I first saw it back in the mid-90's as a Vanguard Video selection. It has retained it power.<br /><br />It is interesting from several aspects. One is that it is based on a true story. Two is it is a launching pad for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And three, it has Dennis Hopper in one of his better social misfit/psychotic character roles.<br /><br />The movie is also a study in the way people act in different settings. You have characters in one-on-one, family, peer group, school, general society settings, etc. The story does well in demonstrating how a person will act in each setting.<br /><br />I wish I could find the details of the actual murder to compare to the movie. I saw a short bit that indicated it occurred in California and that several schoolmates were taken to view the corpse. <br /><br />This is a good choice for a rainy night video rental.

Eric Roberts laconic, nice investigator, his voiceover narration, the twisting plot, Dan Hedaya and Denis Lipscomb given good roles, the settings, the paintings in the artist studio scenes, the end credit sequence and the wonderfully haunting theme music that perfectly encapsulates the mood of the whole film. If I have any reservations it is about Beverly D'Angelo as the femme fatale, but she plays her final scenes beautifully.

"the ultimate greasy spoon. i was waiting for a mexican ""flo"" to walk out. the service is good, the coffee is good, and the food comes in large quantities with a boat-load of calories...and taste. 3 words for you: biscuits and gravy. this is our breakfast spot from now on when we're in the reno area. plenty of parking, and the prices are just right. enjoy.

ps: didn't see any roaches, but i have seen them at restaurants that charge 4 times what these guys do.",1
authentic? yep. fresh? yep. delicious? absolutely! i'm so glad we stumbled upon this hidden hendersonville gem. the restaurant scene in hendersonville is hit or miss.. but el trompo is definitely a hit! i got the burrito gusano al pastor with grilled onions. my husband got the burrito gusano chorizo and one fish taco. all of it was so incredibly delicious. to top it off- the service was so helpful and friendly. we cannot wait to come back!,1
"Ed (coincidentally an editor) is hired to cut horror films down to be favorable in Europe (where standards are much more rigorous). But he finds the films very mind-destroying and starts going a little bit mad. Okay, ""a little bit"" might be an understatement.<br /><br />Let me just say this first of all: best. opening. scene. ever. A man in an office who blows up his head with a grenade. His boss then says -- with a straight face -- ""you're fired"". The entire film does not keep up this level of intensity, but it certainly tries.<br /><br />Take the shotgun scenes, the decapitation, the clips from ""Lost Limbs"" (which my friend Jason wishes were a real film). The writer of this film thought up the idea of a woman who gets raped by a beaver and then immediately after gets shot in the face with a bazooka. That is something you won't find in any other movie (at least, I'm pretty doubtful you will).<br /><br />This film's biggest flaw is the quality. The picture isn't as crisp as a 1997 film should be, and the sound could be touched up (though it's not bad). I thought I was watching a 1980s film. Although, that gave it a bit of a boost in my mind -- the film also had the 1980s style of writing and directing in it: a sense of fun and giving the audience a little something extra over the top. I do miss those days.<br /><br />I wish I had more to say, though at the moment I cannot think of anything strong enough to praise this film. I do think you ought to see this. You've seen the box in your video store with the ax splitting the head... maybe you've passed it up a few times. Maybe you thought it would be cheesy. Pick it up. Savor it.",1
"Presenting Lily Mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress Judy Garland, along with her standard singing moments. The plot consists of Lily Mars tagging along after producer John Thornway for her big break. I think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this film for everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!",1

"/*may contain SPOILERS, but of course it does not matter :) */<br /><br />Battleship Potemkin is one stunning spectacle of haunting images. The visual direction is (well, and has been) inspiring, the sheer scale of the film is impressive, and the technique is certainly pioneering. What is really amazing is, to my mind, the depth and effectiveness of a film, devoid of proper literary script, sound (save the soundtrack), decent image quality, the faux-profound (self-)referentialism of today, exceptional acting, pretense, etc. What you get is a purely visual experience to be remembered.<br /><br />BTW, the previous poster noted: ""Eisenstien felt after a lot of suffering to give the heroes what they wanted. The problem is that you think Eisenstein is building up to a big final fight and then he tricks you. It's a little cheap. I would've rather seen a huge final action scene.""<br /><br />I must warn you, that the end is not cheap, and Eisenstein wasn't being generous to the heroes. History, however, was. Potemkin really did go through the squadron as it was shown in the film.<br /><br />Finally, I'd strongly recommend seeing Battleship Potemkin to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema. See it with a fellow movie buff, it kept me talking for hours. However, if you tend to consider films, generally accepted as ""great"" or ""classic"", to be ""slow"" or ""boring"", this film might not be for you yet. Not much cheap entertainment here.<br /><br />For me though, it is a full 10/10.",1
"This enchanting movie is based on a novel by Arto Paasilinna. The bestseller is one of the best books I've read. Here's the story:<br /><br />One day journalist and photographer Kaarlo Vatanen decides to leave his past behind, and starts a new life wandering across the Finnish forests and countryside. With him he has a companion, a young hare hit by a car. Vatanen has to take care of the hare, because it's leg is wounded, so they start a journey together taking care of each other.<br /><br />In the course of their adventures they get almost shot by hunters, get caught by the police, meet many people and finally get to lapland, where they live peacefully, until a group of foreign tourist disturbs their privacy. The hare falls ill and they must return to Helsinki to see the vet.<br /><br />Vatanen has found an ideal way of living, but the modern society tries to tie him back to his duties and taxes. In Helsinki Vatanen took to drink, gets even engaged and imprisoned, but finally he and the hare flee.",1

"was here in indy for only three days but i went back here twice. my friend and i wanted to eat somewhere before heading over to lucas oil stadium for some drum corps performances and we decided on nada because of 4.5 stars. interior is lively and hip; booth seating was very comfortable. great first impressions. servers were incredibly friendly, professional, and gave great recommendations!

we ordered the crispy pork belly tacos, quesadilla salad, and mex'orean fried chicken. i also ordered the nada lemonade; personally it was a tad sweet for me, but i loved the sweet and sour balance.  

when our fried chicken came, my friend and i made the same weird face and didn't know what to expect. i already ain't a big fan of boneless chicken, but it was $3 and we were only here for a few days so why not, right? decided to just go for that first bite. did not regret it at all. so deliciously crunchy but not overwhelming, and the sauce was delish!! great sweet addition to this mex-korean fusion.

the pork belly tacos were bomb. it's not a very conventional pork belly taste, but its flavors were great. it was crispy without tasting tough, and i normally don't like to eat the fat on pork belly but i finished all of it; it would've felt wrong not to. my friend loved her quesadilla salad but couldn't finish because she was already feeling full. 

while chatting we eyeballed some desserts that a waiter had been carrying and decided on an order of churros. best decision of my life. after eating our main dishes we were pretty full and were worried we wouldn't be able to finish them, but when the churros arrived... holy crap. first bite was such a foodgasm. softest, fluffiest best churros i've ever had. comes with two dips: milk chocolate and bananas foster. decided to try the bananas foster while my friend tried the other (she hates fruit). best. pairing. ever. i completely demolished my half of the churros and wanted so much more but we had to get going. so much for being full. haha

on the second day, my friend, her friend, and i went to harry & izzy's but decided to bail because the wait was way too long. decided to drop by here again (especially so we could introduce her friend to the delicious churros). hosts said that there would be a ton of reservations coming in soon; we were about to give up and thought we would have to settle for something like steak 'n shake, but they were able to combine two 2-person tables for us. we ordered al pastor, baja fish, and pork belly. all were fantastic dishes and its toppings really helped bring out some bright flavor profiles and balanced the protein. also ordered chips and salsa this time... wow. chips were super fresh, salsa was incredible, and our server replaced our batch with a whole new fresher one when we hadn't even finished.

definitely not disappointed!! however, i'm super sad now because i won't be back for a long time, if not ever. wish i could've stayed longer just for those damn churros. it's a shame california can't compare to this place. if i do come back to indy, this is the first place i'm hitting up.",1
is a pretty decent little documentary,1

"Despite looking dated, ""Inki and the Minah Bird"" is, my opinion, an enjoyable and charming cartoon. The artwork isn't extraordinary, but good enough. This cartoon has no dialogs, just sounds and music, but this combination works out pretty well. The cartoon itself is good, funny, old fashioned, creative, entertaining and amusing.<br /><br />This cartoon also makes the difference because it focus in just 3 characters: Inki (the little black girl), the Minah Bird (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion that wants to have both Inki and Minah for breakfast - so he chases them both during most of the cartoon.<br /><br />I actually find that lion very handsome, hilarious and cool. I really like that lion. That poor lion is so silly and loser that you have to feel sorry for him. For me, the real enemy is the Minah Bird, not the lion. At one point, the lion almost eats it - too bad he doesn't get to gulp it, because it deserved to be eaten.<br /><br />Back to this animated short, there isn't a single dull or boring moment. At least for me. The only bit that I find stupid is the ending because the bird has a major fight with the lion, steals his teeth and puts them on itself. Other than that, I have nothing major to criticize about this, aside the fact that the steak should've definitely have gone for the lion and not the bird.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is a very forgotten and underrated little jewel that should definitely get more credit.",1
