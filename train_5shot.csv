"the risk free trial is not risk free.  whatever you do do not give them any form of electronic payment, they will keep charging your account even after you have cancelled it.  i guess if you don't open the email of me cancelling my membership then you have technically not received it,  what a rip off do not join this club",0

"what a great restaurant! ten of us celebrated my daughter's 21st birthday at craft street the food was amazing, the service was top notch. we will all be dining there again soon.",1
"this is not a review on the sushi.  i had a few bites of my friend's order and it was just average compared to the sushi bars in sf, ca.  

however, the korean owners sure made a good beef bulgogi!  it was just a tad on the sweet side of the dish but it was near perfect.  the hamachi kama was also pretty well done.  those are two pretty hard dishes to do well, so judging by that, the rest can't be that bad.  thumbs up from me.  

plus, free edamame and green tea ice cream are always a welcomed bonus.

why are so many japanese restaurants in tucson owned by koreans?!  also, what is up with the lack of chinese cuisine???    i'm perplexed.",1
"i love this place! great food and largest election of beer ever. i recommend the chicken swamp nachos, they even have a selection of gluten free beers:)",1
"my first review! my wife and i went a few days after the grand opening. although they were sold out of a few things the selection was excellent. the food took a little longer than it should have but considering the restaurant had just opened it was a non issue. some of the reviews are unfair. you can't go to a restaurant when it first opens and expect everything to be absolutely perfect. if that is what you expect you should not go to a brand new restaurant. overall the food was very good. the sweet potato tots were da bomb. the bartender,jeff was excellent. we both really enjoyed the conversation.",1
"i needed my car back on the road day-of and these guys were able to get me on their schedule (the day before easter sunday, no less)! so impressed. the techs were knowledgeable, friendly, and made me feel comfortable. they really took the stress out of car repair. thanks again guys, i know who i'm going to next time!",1
